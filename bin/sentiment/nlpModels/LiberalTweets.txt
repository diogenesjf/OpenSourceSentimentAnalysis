With only three weeks left for Congress to pass the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), one man is standing in its way: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA).  The House passed a version of VAWA last May by a narrow 222-205 vote, which stripped protections for LGBT, immigrant and Native American women included in an earlier Senate version of the bill.  The Senate version passed by a now-rare 68 vote super majority, including every female Senator.  
So, whats the hold up?  Protections for Native American women.  As law enforcement, victims, and advocates have turned up pressure to pass the widely-supported Senate bill before the end of the year, other Republican House leaders have changed course and offered a compromise. Two members of senior Republican leadership, Reps. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Tom Cole (R-OK), an enrolled member of the Chicasaw Nation, introduced a stand alone bill that responds to their caucus concern about the Senate bill.  The concern is over a provision that restores local tribal authority to prosecute domestic violence against Native American women.  The Issa-Cole compromise adds protections for defendants with a new option to remove the case to federal court.  In fact, Issa tried to offer this language as an amendment during committee consideration of the bill, but was shut down by Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) who didnt even allow a vote on it.
Although it is expected that the Majority Leader has worked through a compromise with advocates on the LGBT and immigration provisions, he has dug in his heels on stripping the Native American protections, even in light of the Issa-Cole compromise language. 
After an election rife with statements splitting hairs over the definition of rape, and justifying unfair treatment of women, Republicans are scrambling to mend their partys image when it comes to women and the inability to compromise.  With few work days left in the 112th Congress, time is running out for this landmark legislation that strengthens law enforcement and funds services for victims of rape and domestic violence.  That may explain why Republican leaders are now at odds with each other over holding up a domestic violence bill that sailed through Congress three times before.  Even Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-TX), who offered a similar stripped-down version of VAWA during consideration in the Senate, ended up voting for the bill that included full protections for Native, immigrant and LGBT victims.  As the Majority Leader ponders how to move forward, he may want to take a cue from Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), another fellow Republican: Rape is rape, and theres no splitting hairs over rape.

When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) announced that he was wrong to oppose filibuster reform in 2011, he named two senators as prophetic advocates of reform, Sens. Tom Udall (D-NM) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR). These two senators will now play a key role in shaping the filibuster reform package that Senate Democrats ultimately bring to the Senate floor next month. In an exclusive interview with ThinkProgress, Sen. Merkley laid out what he believes that package will include and what he hopes to add to it. His remarks should give progressives hope. 
Merkley began the interview by endorsing two reforms that it was already clear would be included in the reform package this January: eliminating the minoritys ability to filibuster the same bill more than once and requiring a senator to speak on the floor in order to maintain a filibuster. Reid already publicly endorsed both of these proposals. Yet, as ThinkProgress has explained, they are not sufficient in and of themselves to prevent widespread obstructionism. 
Sen. Merkley, however, listed several other reforms he would like to include in the final package that, together with the two Reid has already endorsed, add up to something quite meaningful. Under current Senate rules, the minority can force up to 30 hours of floor time to be wasted even after a supermajority of the Senate votes to break a filibuster on a nominee. And while 30 hours may not seem like a lot, when they are multiplied across the hundreds of nominees a president must confirm, these 30 hours enables the minority to literally force the Senate to waste years of precious work time doing nothing but confirming judges and executive branch officials. These 30 hours are likely the single greatest tool an obstructionist minority possess, and Senate Republicans wielded this tool to great effect in order to block President Obamas nominees.
Merkley called for eliminating this opportunity for obstruction completely:
Two years ago, the package that Tom Udall and I put together included reducing those 30 hours to 2 hours, so people could make a final comment as their colleagues were about to vote. And something like that is appropriate. I think it could even be appropriate to go to zero hours, and heres why: it takes two days for a cloture petition to ripen. What that means is that, by the time you file it, and its all public, you have to wait until the day after an intervening day. And so theres plenty of time for people to make their final case once that petition is there. So if you reduce it to zero hours, you can have a series of cloture petitions and a series of votes that no one could basically — on a Thursday night or a Friday night you could go through a whole series of judges.
Watch it:

This is a serious proposal, and it would do more to restore the Senates ability to function than anything else that has been seriously discussed since the election. So long as John Boehner controls the House, there is little the Senate can do to pass legislation over Republican objections. Merkleys proposal to eliminate these 30 hours of delay, however, would completely strip away one of the current minoritys favorite tactics — filibustering nominees they dont even oppose.

Michigan workers protest outside the state capitol Thursday On Thursday, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) backtracked on his commitment to avoid so-called right-to-work legislation and by the end of the day, both the Michigan House of Representatives and the Michigan state Senate had introduced and passed separate bills aimed at the states union workforce.
Michigan Republicans claim the state needs the measure to stay competitive with Indiana, where lawmakers passed right-to-work last year. In reality, though, such laws have negative effects on workers and little effect on economic growth. Here is what you need to know about the state GOPs campaign: 
THE LEGISLATION: Both the state House and state Senate passed legislation on Thursday that prohibits private sector unions from requiring members to pay dues. The Senate followed suit and passed a different but similar measure that extends the same prohibition for public sector unions, though firefighters and police officers are exempt. The state House included a budget appropriations provision that is intended to prevent the states voters from being able to legally challenge the law through a ballot referendum. Due to state law, both houses are prevented from voting on legislation passed by the other for five days, so neither will be able to fully pass the legislation until Tuesday at the earliest.
THE PROCESS: Union leaders and Democrats claim that Republicans are pushing the legislation through in the lame-duck session to hide the intent of the measures from citizens, and because the legislation would face more trouble after the new House convenes in January. Michigan Republicans hold a 63-47 advantage in the state House, but Democrats narrowed the GOP majority to just eight seats in November. Six Republicans opposed the House measure; five of them won re-election in 2012 (the sixth retired). And Michigan Republicans have good reason to pursue the laws without public debate. Though the states voters are evenly split on whether it should become a right-to-work state, 78 percent of voters said the legislature should focus on issues like creating jobs and improving education, and not changing state laws or rules that would impact unions or make further changes in collective bargaining. 
THE CONSEQUENCES: While Snyder and Republicans pitched right-to-work as a pro-worker move aimed at improving the economy, studies show such legislation can cost workers money. The Economic Policy Institute found that right-to-work laws cost all workers, union and otherwise, $1,500 a year in wages and that they make it harder for workers to obtain pensions and health coverage. If benefits coverage in non-right-to-work states were lowered to the levels of states with these laws, 2 million fewer workers would receive health insurance and 3.8 million fewer workers would receive pensions nationwide, David Madland and Karla Walter from the Center for American Progress wrote earlier this year. The decreases in union membership that result from right-to-work laws have a significant impact on the middle class and research shows that there is no relationship between right-to-work laws and state unemployment rates, state per capita income, or state job growth, EPI wrote in a recent report about Michigan. Right-to-work laws also decrease worker safety and can hurt small businesses.

Union leaders are, of course, aghast at Snyder and the GOPs right-to-work push. In a state that gave birth to the modern U.S. labor movement, it is unconscionable that Michigan legislators would seek to drive down living standards for Michigan workers and families with a law that will do nothing to improve either the states economic climate or the quality of life for Michigan residents, RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, said in a statement.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is displeased that, in the wake of the end of Jersey Shore, in part because some of that shows stars started doing things like having babies and acquiring responsibilities other than partying, MTV is coming to his state with a show that will start airing next year called Buckwild. The program will follow the antics of a group of twenty-somethings who live in a 4,000-person town. The Washington Post reports on his letter to MTV:
As a U.S. Senator, I am repulsed at this business venture, where some Americans are making money off of the poor decisions of our youth, Manchin wrote. I cannot imagine that anyone who loves this country would feel proud profiting off of ‘Buckwild.
Instead of showcasing the beauty of our people and our state, you preyed on young people, coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior — and now you are profiting from it. That is just wrong.
In an interview Thursday before sending the letter, Manchin repeatedly called MTVs decision just awful.
I have no problem with people in this country trying to earn a profit, but I would ask them: Would they do this to their own children, in their own neighborhood, in their own home state? Manchin said.
It would be nice of Manchin, in the course of defending the innocent young people of his state, would recognize that his own constituents are among the people who are making money off of the poor decisions of our youth. There are definitely reality television programs that can be exploitative. Scenes can be cut to be misleading. Producers can be less than honest with participants about their intentions for a project. And no matter how much anyone does to prepare the subjects of a reality show for the limelight, theres no way to predict what the reaction to a program will be until it airs, or how people who havent previously broadcast their lives will react to being characters, as opposed to actual humans. 
But were also at a point in the development of reality television where many, many people who agree to participate in it are aware of the genres conventions, and go into the process with open eyes and a clear sense of how they can leverage the process to their own advantage. The subjects of Breaking Amish appear to have given the producers what they wanted, no matter the facts of their actual lives. I have qualms about making very young children the main characters of reality shows, but the adults who are participating in a program like Here Comes Honey Boo Boo seem self-aware and happy, and rather than becoming objects of pure ridicule, there are a lot of people who have found them rather likable. Jersey Shore‘s stars showed a determined willingness to make fools of themselves, but in a way that was mostly calculated, rather than desperate.
If I were Manchin, I might have a little more respect for my constituents. The only real argument I can see making is that rather than setting the show in Sissonville, which is in Kanawha County in West Virginia, which has 6.1 percent unemployment, down from 6.7 percent last year, MTV might have considered going to Clay County, where the unemployment rate is 13.5 percent, up from 10.6 percent last year.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyders (R) attempt to push a union-busting right-to-work law through the state legislature this week was met with considerable opposition from labor groups, who have protested en masse both outside and inside the state capitol in Lansing since Snyder announced his support for the law on Thursday. 
Today, the legislation has a new foe: the National Football League Players Association, which represents players on Michigans NFL franchise, the Detroit Lions, and has come out against right-to-work before.
We stood up against this in the past, and we stand against it in its current form in Michigan, George Atallah, the associations assistant executive director for external affairs, told ThinkProgress in a phone interview. Our leadership and players are always proud to stand with workers in Michigan and everywhere else. We dont think voters chose this, and we dont think workers deserve this.
The NFLPA is no stranger to labor disputes. NFL owners locked out players before the start of the 2011 season, and the players association was vocal in its support of the NFL Referees Association when the league locked out its officials at the beginning of this season.
Last year, the NFLPA opposed Indianas push for right-to-work just weeks before Indianapolis hosted Super Bowl XLVI. We share all the same issues that the American people share, NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith told The Nation at the time. We want decent wages. We want a fair pension. We want to be taken care of when we get hurt. We want a decent and safe working environment. So when you look at proposed legislation in a place like Indiana that wants to call it something like ‘Right to Work, I mean, lets just put the hammer on the nail. Its untrue.
Players, including Chicago Bears quarterback and Indiana native Jay Cutler, also spoke out against the Indiana law. While in Indianapolis, Smith marched with the UNITE-HERE union when its hotel workers were protesting low wages, missed overtime pay, and the firing of contract workers at local Hyatt hotels.
With such a short time table between introduction of the Michigan legislation and expected passage, Atallah said the players association had no plans for public actions against the right-to-work proceedings, but he iterated that the union stands with workers in Michigan. We disagree with it and well continue to stand with Michigans workers, Atallah said.
Update   In an email to ThinkProgress, Major League Baseball Players Association Executive Director Michael Weiner said his union also opposes the right-to-work push.
Major League Baseball Players Association has always stood by the principle that all who reap the many benefits of union representation should contribute to their operation, Weiner said. All union members — either auto workers, teachers, firefighters, or the American League champion Detroit Tigers — oppose legislation designed to weaken unions. The economic health of our country cannot be revitalized by depriving workers of their voice in the workplace.

The latest filings from Karl Roves American Crossroads show a last minute contribution of $1 million received just days before the election (10/29/12) from Gary Heavin — the co-founder of Curves International Inc., which calls itself the worlds leader in womens fitness.
Curves, a chain of women-only fitness center franchises, claims nearly 10,000 locations in more than 85 countries. Heavin and his fellow co-founder, his wife Diane, sold Curves International to an private equity firm in October, but they remain prominently featured on the companys website. The Heavins say they share a passion for and commitment to womens health and fitness.  But his massive donation to the right-wing super PAC is only the latest in a long pattern of their efforts
in support of policies that undermine womens equality in the workplace and restrict womens access to health care services.
American Crossroads spent $91 million to elect Mitt Romney over President Obama. Romney refused to endorse key pro-women legislation including the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act, the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and the Paycheck Fairness Act, but backed reinstating the global gag rule on even discussing abortion as a family planning option and supported the infamous Blunt Amendment to allow employers to deny health benefits that go against their personal views. Crossroads also worked to help far-right extremists like Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, and George Allen. Much of the American Crossroads attack strategy focused on criticizing Obamacare and those who backed the effort to expand health insurance access to all Americans.
In addition to helping fund American Crossroads, the Heavins also combined to give $92,400 to the House and Senate Republican campaign arms, $2,500 to Texas Governor Rick Perry (R), $30,800 to the Republican National Committee, $7,300 to Romneys campaign, and $2,500 to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) in 2012.
And this past election isnt the only time that Curves and the Heavins have worked against womens reproductive rights. Gary Heavin pledged hundreds of thousands of dollars for controversial pregnancy crisis centers that try to talk women out of abortions and have been accused to providing false information. They also made large donations to abstinence-only education programs — programs which often misinform and make teens more likely to engage in risky behavior and become pregnant. Curves also pulled its funding for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation over its objection to the charitys funding for Planned Parenthoods breast cancer screening services. In a 2004 editorial, Mr. Heavin attacked Planned Parenthoods sex education literature, writing I have a 10-year-old daughter. I would absolutely not allow her to be exposed to this material. I dont want her being taught masturbation and told that homosexuality is normal.
That anti-choice and anti-LGBT stance was further demonstrated when Curves partnered with the American Family Association — a group that has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. They joined for a 2009 healthy recipe contest and sold a Curves fitness CD on the AFAs website.  Gary Heavin has also been an outspoken enthusiast for televangelist Pat Robertson, who has blamed natural disasters on same-sex marriage equality and blamed 9/11 on abortion, the separation of church and state, and civil liberties groups.

Friday marks exactly one year since the Health and Human Services Department overruled the FDA to restrict access to emergency contraception for women under the age of 17, disregarding the FDAs recommendation that Plan B — which medical research shows is actually safer than aspirin — should be available to women of all ages. When HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius rejected the FDAs guidelines on emergency contraception last year, some Democratic lawmakers suggested that decision was politically motivated rather than scientifically based. 
Now, with the presidential election behind them, womens health advocates are renewing their pressure on the Obama administration to reverse that policy:
We are asking Secretary Sebelius to go back and take another look at the science, the medical evidence … and see if theres a way to come to agreement to make this product more easily available to the women who need it, says Kirsten Moore, president and CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project. [...]
Moreover, Moore says, she thinks the election shows that there would be no political price to be paid by the administration for making what advocates say is the science-based decision.
If there was concern that doing the right thing by emergency contraception was going to get people into trouble, she says, I think that questions been asked and answered politically.
Under the current federal guidelines, women younger than 17 years old must obtain a prescription from their doctor before being able to purchase Plan B. And the age restrictions have further complicated the stigma around emergency contraception, so even those over the age of 17 run into roadblocks when they attempt to legally purchase Plan B over the counter. Pharmacists often falsely tell women they may not purchase emergency contraception without a prescription, or incorrectly deny Plan B to men, or simply refuse to dispense emergency contraception for their own personal reasons. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics has criticized the Obama administrations age restrictions for posing a significant hurdle to the young women who need access to emergency contraception in a timely manner, especially since Plan B is the most effective when its taken within 24 hours of sexual contact. And the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently recommended that all forms of birth control should be easily accessible over the counter, since women more regularly take effective forms of birth control when they dont face any roadblocks to accessing them.
Kirsten Moore also believes the voters who reelected President Obama sent a strong message to his administration about their position on these issues — and Obama now has an obligation to follow through for them. The voters said very clearly this past November that when it comes to womens health, they think that prevention is a good thing; providing contraception is a good thing; reducing barriers to access, whether it be cost, is a good thing, she explained to NPR. And they supported a candidate who clearly made that a part of his message.

Fox News really doesnt seem to have anything better to do in December than continue to manufacture the silly War on Christmas and then take real umbrage to the fake campaign. Despite Jon Stewarts epic dismantling earlier this week, Bill OReilly continues his reverse-crusade, and now hes implicating women and LGBT people in the process. Last night, he and Bernard McGuirk, executive producer of Imus in the Morning, revealed that they actually believe theres a war against Christianity thats being led by champions of the right to choose and LGBT equality:
MCGUIRK: The war on Christmas is very, very real, and if you ask me, in addition to some grouchy misanthropic heathen atheists it has to do — at the root of it — with two things — abortion and the gay rights agenda, because Christianity is against those things. Its subtle but thats why its so pronounced in recent years.
OREILLY: Hundred percent agree. I absolutely agree 100 percent that the diminishment of Christianity is the target and Christmas is the vehicle because the secularists know the opposition to their agenda (legalized drugs is in that as well) comes primarily from the Judeo-Christian traditionalist people.
Watch it (via Towleroad/Mediaite):

While the inclusion of these two important issues in this holiday charade is offensive enough, McGuirks pronouncement that all of Christianity opposes a womans right to an abortion or a gay couples right to raise a family ignores the fact that many women and gay people are Christian. In terms of the so-called gay rights agenda, many Christian denominations — including Presbyterians, Lutherans, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Methodists and others — wholeheartedly support the LGBT community and are partners in advocating for marriage equality. If anything, its Fox News whos waging a war on the millions of Christians who dont agree with the networks conservative positions.

 An Ohio Senate subcommittee has agreed to hear the case for making drug tests mandatory for welfare recipients, reports the Columbus Dispatch. The bill was introduced over a year ago, but now contains revisions including $100,000 allotted to rehab and treatment programs. Another provision modifies the original requirement by only testing people who admit on the application that they have used illegal drugs. Applicants must pass the drug test before they can receive benefits.
Sen. Tim Schaffer (R-OH) sponsored the bill, claiming that he actually intends to help Ohioans with drug problems:
Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, said the legislation would help alleviate drug use among low-income Ohioans and ensure that public-assistance dollars are used to help families through hard times, not to support drug habits. If they need help, they will get it, Schaffer said.
[...]
It is our hope this pilot program will break generational drug usage and end the death by drug abuse for too many of our citizens. They deserve more from us than a generic handout. They need our assistance in getting their lives on track for both them and their dependents, Crawford County Commissioner Jenny Vermillion testified before the Senate Committee.
In fact, the welfare drug test has been a popular policy among Republican lawmakers who would like to undermine welfare programs and cut down on eligible recipients. Ohio Democrats responded to last years proposal for a welfare drug test with their own legislation that would require the states elected officials to also submit to a drug test.
Florida, another state that implemented the mandatory drug test, saved nothing on welfare benefits and failed to reduce the number of applications in the laws brief four-month life span. Only 108 people tested positive for drugs out of 4,086 applicants. The Florida experiment only served to prove that welfare recipients are actually less likely to abuse drugs than the general public.
Despite the evidence, the welfare drug test has gained traction in several Republican-dominated state legislatures, including Kansas and Virginia. Virginias proposal failed last year when it was determined that the drug tests would cost the state $1.5 million to administer the tests and save only $229,000 in benefits stripped from recipients who tested positive. The costly requirement serves only to stigmatize welfare recipients and perpetuate the misguided stereotype that low-income Americans are irresponsible drug addicts. Ohios bill could also expose the state to expensive lawsuits, as mandatory drug testing has been struck down time and again in the courts.

On Thursday, CNN host Anderson Cooper shone the spotlight on Republicans who voted against a U.N. treaty protecting people with disabilities, highlighting lawmakers who backed away from supporting the measure in response to conservative misinformation and opposition. 
Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) featured prominently in Coopers Keeping Them Honest segment. He reported that Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS), formerly a co-sponsor of the motion to ratify the treaty, suddenly backed out even after meeting with former GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole, a proponent of the measure.
The lawmakers declined an invitation to come onto the show to explain themselves, leaving Cooper to condemn their dishonesty: 
COOPER: And keeping them honest, they used arguments that just frankly did not square with the facts. They werent true. [...] We can only guess their motivations, and frankly, some of this is just so baffling that wed be taking wild guesses, and we just dont want to do that.
Watch Coopers full segment here:

Prominent conservative groups, rallied by Rick Santorum, denounced the treaty on the false premise that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) would strip parents with disabled children of their rights. As a result of their efforts, though, the treaty failed by a mere five votes. 
The Republicans who changed their votes have drawn widespread criticism from disabilities rights groups and Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised to bring the treaty up for a vote in the next session of Congress.

Suzanne VenkerFox News has published another sexist op-ed by Suzanne Venker, the author who became infamous for attacking a fictional War on Men. In the follow up piece, Venker argues that women are naturally mens inferiors.
The author believes the crudest of crude gender stereotypes are built into male and female brains, arguing that women like to gather and nest and take care of people while men are hunters: they like to build things and kill things. As a consequence, she maintains a mans place is in the office; his woman should simply surrender to his rule:
[W]omen shouldnt let their success in the workplace become the biggest thing in their lives. If the ultimate goal is lasting love – and lets face it: for most people it is – women are going to have to become comfortable with sacrifice and capitulation. …
Surrendering to your femininity means many things. It means letting your man be the man despite the fact that youve proven youre his equal. It means recognizing the fact that you may very well want to stay home with your babies – and that thats normal. Surrendering to your femininity means if you do work outside the home, you dont use your work to play tit for tat in your marriage. It means tapping into that part of yourself thats genuinely vulnerable and really does need a man – even though the culture says you dont.
In other words, put down your sword. Its okay if your guys in charge. Its okay if you dont drive the car. In fact, its rather liberating.
These views are not supported by modern neuroscience, which finds that brain differences between men and women are hard to pinpoint and often a result of social pressures rather than biology. Moreover, the reason that many women are unhappy with their worklives is more about institutionalized sexism than some innate need to be cared for by a strong man.
Venkers justification for unequal gender roles, men and women are different, literally harkens back a hundred years: one of the main arguments advanced against womens suffrage was that it wasnt natural for women to participate in public life outside of the home. And though Venker says with no sense of irony that she believes women are equal, but different, views like hers are strongly associated with excusing domestic violence and gender discrimination.
Fox News has a storied history of using its megaphone to broadcast sexism. Host Brian Kilmeade has said on-air that Women are everywhere. Were letting them play golf and tennis now. Its out of control and that the network hires female anchors by going into the Victorias Secret catalogue and [saying], ‘Can any of these people talk?

Javon Belcher and Kasandra PerkinsNBC sports anchor Bob Costas believes that Kasandra Perkins life could have been saved had her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs Linebacker Javon Belcher, not had access to a firearm. The CEO of the National Rifle Association, on the other hand, thinks the situation might have resolved itself had both Belcher and Perkins had guns.
CEO Wayne LaPierre made the case on NRA News, arguing that Costas, wouldnt have said a thing [after the shooting] if this woman had saved her life by having a firearm available from Jovan Belcher. He wouldnt have said anything about it. He later followed up the argument in an interview with USA Today:
The one thing missing in that equation is that woman owning a gun so she could have saved her life from that murderer, LaPierre told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday [...]
Owning guns is a mainstream part of American culture and its growing every day. My God, theres nothing more mainstream in this country than 100 million Americans who own firearms.
Whether or not Perkins owned a gun, the woman was obviously unprepared for the sudden attack that ended her life last Saturday. Had she been armed, its possible the event could have become a shootout — further endangering the two onlookers to Perkins murder: The couples infant daughter, and Belchers mother. 
Having a gun in the home increases the likelihood of both murders and suicides. According to the Brady Campaign, A gun in the home is more likely to be used in a homicide, suicide, or unintentional shooting than to be used in self-defense.
Put simply, Perkins was a victim of domestic violence by a man who was able to purchase guns that, until the incident occurred, LaPierre would have said were for self-protection. The two guns Belcher used (on himself and Perkins) were both obtained legally.

Washington states law to legalize and regulate marijuana goes into effect today. While dispensaries wont be licensed to sell for at least another year, today marks the first day when possession of an ounce or less of marijuana becomes legal for those 21 and older – under state law, that is. Here are five things you should know as the state begins implementation of the law.
1. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law. The federal Controlled Substances Act makes marijuana illegal, and while the Obama administration has said little to clarify how it will react to the passage of this law and a similar one in Colorado, the U.S. Attorneys office in Seattle did issue a statement Wednesday evening clarifying that, by their law, possessing and selling pot is still a crime:
The Department of Justice is reviewing the legalization initiatives recently passed in Colorado and Washington State. The Departments responsibility to enforce the Controlled Substances Act remains unchanged. Neither States nor the Executive branch can nullify a statute passed by Congress. In enacting the Controlled Substances Act, Congress determined that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. Regardless of any changes in state law, including the change that will go into effect on December 6th in Washington State, growing, selling or possessing any amount of marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
2. It is still illegal to smoke or consume marijuana in public, but its not a state crime. As Washingtons law went into effect at 12:01 this morning, crowds gathered around the Seattle Space Needle to light up. But dont be fooled; the act of smoking in public is not legal. I-502 provides that it is unlawful to open a package or consume a product containing marijuana, useable marijuana, or a marijuana-infused product in view of the general public. The penalty for violating this provision, however, is a civil fine of about $100.
3. Dont bring your pot to national parks or federal courthouses. While smoking marijuana in public places is generally only subject to a fine, the consequences may be much harsher if you do so on federal property. In its statement Wednesday night, the U.S. Attorneys Office in Seattle reminds members of the public that it remains against federal law to bring any amount of marijuana onto federal property, including all federal buildings, national parks and forests, military installations, and courthouses. Of course, the federal governments reminder also means that smoking in public anywhere, really, could get you in bigger trouble if federal prosecutors choose to change their prosecution tactics and charge you under federal law. Historically, however, federal prosecutors almost never target mere possession of small amounts of marijuana, and it would be a colossal and burdensome misuse of their resources if they were to start now.
4. As of today, there is no legal way to distribute pot. While I-502 does contain a scheme for regulating marijuana production and sales through licensing dispensaries, those regulations dont go into effect until late next year, after which interested dispensaries will have to first go through the application process. If implementation of the medical marijuana laws in many states is any indication, getting dispensaries up and running will take several years. And without licensed dispensaries, there is no legal way to sell — or even give away – marijuana.
5. Today marks the beginning of the end of harsh and discriminatory criminalization of minor marijuana offenses in Washington state. As revelrous pot-smokers celebrate their newfound liberty to consume marijuana, its easy to forget many of the primary reasons the laws drafters proposed the law: marijuana laws disproportionately target racial minorities, fill our jails with nonviolent individuals who then become embroiled in the criminal justice system, and funnel illicit funds to violent gangs. As Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes explained to ThinkProgress earlier this year:
Prohibition has failed in every legitimate public safety goal. … 59% of the [marijuana] cases that were pending when I took office on Jan. 1, 2010, were against African Americans. That in a city with a 7% African American population. The only achievement if you will of marijuana prohibition in this case has been to make sure that we become the number one jailer nation on the planet, and its only made certain that only criminals are getting wealthy from the sale of marijuana.

Continuing efforts to cut spending and reduce deficits have driven the Eurozone into its second recession in just four years, as its economy shrank for the second consecutive quarter. Struggling countries like Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland are still pursuing deficit reduction to rein in their debt, cutting spending to the bone to do so. The spending cuts have driven unemployment to record levels and threatened the continent with a recession that became official during the last quarter, Bloomberg reports:
The euro-area economy was pushed into a recession for the second time in four years as trade slowed and government spending declined.
Gross domestic product in the 17-nation currency bloc slipped 0.1 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months, when it fell 0.2 percent, the European Unions statistics office in Luxembourg said today, confirming an initial estimate published on Nov. 15.
Eurozone unemployment reached 26 percent in September. The youth unemployment rate has topped 50 percent and resulted in a lost generation for the continents young adults. Still, the pursuit of austerity continues.
Lawmakers around the world have ignored the European lesson, though. Australias growth slowed last quarter as its government pursued deficit reduction, and in the United States, the so-called fiscal cliff brought on by Republican-demanded spending cuts is threatening the country with a bigger austerity package than those that have been implemented in Europe, even with ample proof that the U.S.s original preference toward stimulus was more effective than the austere European approach.

New York Times v. Sullivan is one of the two or three most important free speech cases in American history. In essence, New York Times held that reporters and other individuals cannot be held liable for making unintentionally false statements against public figures so long as they do not do so with reckless disregard of whether [their statement] was false or not. Without this decision, every writer, reporter and blogger in the country would live in constant fear that if they relied on the wrong source or made any of a number of innocent mistakes, the result could be financial ruin.
Indeed, nothing highlights the danger of a different legal regime more than the facts of the New York Times case themselves. Civil rights advocates ran an ad in the New York Times that includes a number of trivial factual errors, such as claiming Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been arrested seven times when in fact he at only been arrested four times when the ad ran. Based on these minor errors, an Alabama court ordered the New York Times and the civil rights leaders to pay $500,000 in a transparent effort to shut down speech critical of Jim Crow — a practice which was very common in the segregationist south. So New York Times v. Sullivan did not simply protect journalism generally, it ended the apartheid states practice of deliberately intimidating people who report on civil rights by awarding massive libel awards to segregationists.
During a recent Charlie Rose interview, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had this to say about the decision:
One of the evolutionary provisions that I abhor is New York Times v. Sullivan. It made a very good system that you can libel public figures at will so long as somebody told you something — some reliable person — told you the lie that you then publicized to the whole world. Thats what New York Times v. Sullivan says. That may well be a good system and the people of New York state could have adopted that by law, but for the Supreme Court to say that the Constitution requires that — thats not what the people understood when they ratified the First Amendment. . . .
The issue is who decides? Who decides whats right? And its the people. The background rule is democracy, and the rule of democracy is the majority rules.
Watch it:

Scalias professed love of democracy is admirable, but the truth is that Scalia only believes in the democratic process when democracy does what he wants it to do. He was one of the five justices who voted to give the presidency to George W. Bush, and he voted to strike down the Affordable Care Act based on reasoning that, in the words of a leading conservative judge, had no basis in either the text of the Constitution or Supreme Court precedent.

Protests against Michigans proposed HB 5711Womens health advocates confirm that Michigan lawmakers are likely to revive on Thursday an omnibus anti-abortion bill that sparked widespread protests after it passed the House this summer, in addition to a host of other restrictive abortion legislation they hope to force through the current lame duck session. 
As Michigans current attempt to pass anti-union legislation dominates the coverage surrounding the state legislature, lawmakers are using the opportunity to revisit anti-abortion measures they hope to slip through before this session ends. Since five anti-choice state legislators lost their seats in last months election, this may be the best time for the legislature to advance their far-right agenda — despite the fact that the majority of Michigan residents support legal access to abortion. On Thursday afternoon, the state senate may consider multiple anti-abortion bills that aim to:
1) Regulate abortion clinics out of existence.  HB 5711, the massive 45-page legislation that sparked a massive outcry when the House considered it in June, contains additional and unnecessary regulations for abortion providers. HB 5711 would subject any facilities that perform 6 or more abortions per month to burdensome regulations that could be so costly that they force clinics to close their doors, an indirect method of targeting abortion providers.
2) Limit abortion access for women in rural areas. HB 5711 would also place restrictions on telemedical abortions, which provide essential health services to women in rural areas who often lack any access to nearby abortion doctors. Even though telemedical procedures have been proven to be safe and effective, Michigan lawmakers seek to require doctors to be physically present to administer abortion services.
3) Impose further guidelines for the disposal of fetal remains. Michigan already has regulations in place to instruct medical professions about how they must dispose of fetal remains, but HB 5711 wants to go a step further, requiring fetal remains to be treated in the exact same manner as dead bodies. Doctors would be forced to fill out death forms and make arrangements for the fetal remains cremation or burial, imposing an emotional burden on the women whose pregnancies end through a medical miscarriage. No other state handles fetal remains at 10 weeks in the same way as it handles dead bodies.
4) Prevent private insurance companies from covering any abortion services. A trio of companion bills — SBs 612, 613, and 614 — would work together to ban the health insurance exchange that Michigan will set up under Obamacare from covering abortion, as well as ban private insurers from covering any abortion services under their general insurance plans. Currently, 87 percent of Michigans insurance plans include abortion care in their benefits packages. If private insurers elect to cover abortions, they have to do it as a separate rider, which often ends up being more costly for women. 
5) Allow doctors to refuse to perform abortion services because of their personal beliefs. SB 975, which passed the Michigan Senates Health Policy committee earlier this week and is now up for a full vote, is a sweeping license to discriminate bill that would allow medical professionals to deny health services based on their personal beliefs. It would allow doctors to refuse to provide HIV treatment, vaccinations, or abortions to any of their patients simply based on their conscience. 
Preliminary reports from womens health advocates on the ground in Michigan suggest that the Senate has already passed SB 975, and is likely to pass SBs 612, 613, and 614 this afternoon. But Thursdays push doesnt represent the only step that Michigan lawmakers have taken during this years lame duck session to push through anti-choice legislation. Just a few weeks ago, state legislators also considered establishing a tax credit for fetuses past 12 weeks gestation, a dangerous step toward endowing fetuses with the same rights as U.S. citizens.

Update   The Huffington Post confirms that the Michigan Senate passed SBs 975, 612, 613, and 614 on Thursday afternoon. Only one Republican state senator broke from his party to oppose SB 975, while the rest of the legislators voted along party lines. The Senate is expected to schedule a vote on HB 5711 sometime during the remainder of this legislative session.

On Thursday, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) announced that he would be resigning his seat in January to take up the position of President at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative tank in Washington D.C. 
The task of replacing the outspoken Tea Party lawmaker now falls to South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who will appoint someone to the seat until a special election can be held in 2014. 
Speculation is already swirling around a handful of names to fill the seat, so ThinkProgress has put together an early look at some of the possible candidates for the job:
Rep. Tim Scott
 Several reports are identifying Scott as DeMints preferred choice to replace him, and for good reason: the freshman congressman has already proven to be nearly as extreme as DeMint himself. In 2011, he voted to extend billions of dollars in subsidies to big oil companies, arguing that taxpayer-funded money going to companies that reap billions in profits was fair. And during the last fight over the debt ceiling, Scott floated the possibility of introducing articles of impeachment against President Obama. While a State Senator, Scott helped to defund South Carolinas entire HIV/AIDS programs, including the elimination of the states AIDs Drug Assistance Program.

Gov. Nikki Haley
She would not be the first Governor to appoint herself to the Senate, and would be well within her authority to do just that. Her approval ratings have remained low for years, trailing even President Obama by 10 points in the reliably red state and jeopardizing her chances of reelection in 2014. She has her own impressive track record of extreme comments and policy proposals, from denying the existence of any war on women to then perpetrating said war by vetoing half a million dollars in funding for abuse and rape prevention crisis centers throughout her state.

Former Attorney General Henry McMaster
McMaster served as South Carolinas Attorney General for six years before launching a bid for the Governors mansion in 2009. He ran in the 2010 GOP primary against Haley, but dropped out of the race and endorsed her ahead of the runoff election in June of that year. As AG, McMaster was one of 16 Republican attorneys general to file suit against ObamaCare. He also cut a political video touting his role in the case, raising questions about whether he filed the frivolous suit — at a tremendous cost to the taxpayers — simply to benefit his own political ambitions.

State Sen. Tom Davis
 He too is a tea party favorite, especially amongst Ron Paul supporters. Conservatives had been trying to convince Davis to challenge South Carolinas other Senator Lindsey Graham in the 2014 GOP primary. Davis gave a speech at Pauls rally in Tampa, Florida during the RNC in which he called Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke a dictator and a traitor.

Rep. Joe Wilson
 With one outburst three years ago, Wilson became perhaps the most well-known congressman in the state. His unprecedented interruption of President Obama during the 2009 State of the Union address made him something of a hero for far-right extremists, and their impression of him has only been reinforced in the intervening years. Wilson is a longtime member of Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group with deep ties to white supremacists and other right-wing extremists. He was an outspoken defender of the confederate flag, and fought to keep it affixed atop the state capital building.

Indiana workers protest passage of right-to-work law in JanuaryAfter insisting all last year that an anti-labor right-to-work law was not on his agenda, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) has changed his mind. This morning, he called on the state legislature to introduce and pass so-called right-to-work legislation and promised to sign it should it reach his desk.
Snyder was among the Midwestern Republican governors who leveled an assault on unions in 2011, but right-to-work, which effectively undermines union activities by allowing non-union workers to free-ride on union-negotiated contracts, is a new front in that fight. Indiana passed right-to-work legislation earlier this year, and by following suit, Michigan can remain competitive with its neighbor while also becoming a better place for workers, Snyder claimed in a video posted by The Detroit News:
SNYDER: There are two main reasons Im asking the Michigan legislature to move forward on a package of bills on workplace fairness and equity, and Im going to sign those bills when they come to my desk. First, its about being pro-worker. Its about hard-working Michiganders having the freedom to choose who they associate with. [...]
The second one is about being more healthy in Michigan, in terms of our economy. If you look at the numbers, the last two years weve done well. We added 140,000 jobs. Were forecasted to add 110,000 jobs over the next two years. [...] I want to see that rate go up, to even be bigger and better. And when I looked at Indiana, heres an opportunity to see that pace increase. 

Though Snyder refers to his agenda as pro-worker, a quick glance at studies of right-to-work legislation paints a different picture. According to the Economic Policy Institute, right-to-work laws have virtually no impact on job growth and have a negative impact on both union and nonunion workers, reducing wages by up to $1,500 a year.  A Ball State University study conducted during Indianas push to pass right-to-work found that no impact is likely for job growth or wages in the manufacturing sector. Another EPI study suggests that right-to-work laws had a negative impact on Oklahomas economy and that right-to-work is is ineffective as a strategy for increasing a states employment.
The right-to-work experiment failed miserably the last time it was tried in the Midwest. Indiana originally passed right-to-work laws in 1957, but orkers hated the new laws so much that they were repealed just eight years later. 
Update   At least eight protesters have been arrested outside the Michigan state capitol during protests of the right-to-work legislation, and police have used pepper spray on other protesters who tried to entire the capitol, the Lansing State-Journal reported. The capitol is currently in exit-only mode, according to state police. 
Update   Michigan Rep. Gary Peters (D) slammed Snyders push for right-to-work in a statement on his web site, saying: Governor Snyder campaigned on a promise of unity, but instead hes ushering in an era of divisiveness across Michigan by launching an attack against working families. … Just like Scott Walker, Governor Snyders flip flop is clearly a calculated decision to put his own political ambitions ahead of the families hes supposed to be working for. I stand in solidarity with Michigans working families, and we will never stop fighting against this unprecedented and reckless action by Governor Snyder. 
Update   Michigans state House has passed the right-to-work legislation by a vote of 58-52. Six Republicans voted against it. 
Update   The Obama administration came out against the measure in a statement to the Huffington Post:

President Obama has long opposed so-called ‘right to work laws and he continues to oppose them now, said White House spokesperson Matt Lehrich. The President believes our economy is stronger when workers get good wages and good benefits, and he opposes attempts to roll back their rights. Michigan – and its workers role in the revival of the US automobile industry – is a prime example of how unions have helped build a strong middle class and a strong American economy.

Bush White House Press Secretary-turned-Fox News host Dana Perino asserted Wednesday night that women who are victims of violence should make better decisions to avoid being hurt.
Perino made the comment on Fox News The Five, in the middle of a discussion of Kansas City Chiefs Line Backer Javon Belcher, who murdered his girlfriend before killing himself over the weekend. While her co-hosts were discussing the merits of female gun ownership as a way to avoid violence against women, Perino was quick to blame women themselves for being victims:
PERINO: I think it skirts the issue that women are victims of violence all the time –
CO-HOST: They should have guns!
PERINO: Well, maybe, or make better decisions.
Watch it:

Perinos comments are a reminder of the importance of the Violence Against Women Act, a bill that plays a vital role in protecting women from violence, particularly intimate partner violence like that between Jovan Belcher and his girlfriend. The third reauthorization of VAWA is currently languishing in Congress, stuck between the updated version that passed the Senate (which includes protections for LGBT and undocumented domestic violence victims), and the Houses slimmed down reauthorization.

In an unexpected move, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC), an arch-conservative and leader of the Tea Party movement, is resigning his seat in order to head up the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington DC.
DeMint has been among the most extreme members of the Senate since first getting elected in 2004, drawing a hard-right line on issues from unions to LGBT rights to abortion and beyond.
Heres a look back at some of DeMints Senate highlights:

1. Stood with Akin after legitimate rape remarks. Following Rep. Todd Akins (R-MO) infamous statement that victims of legitimate rape cant become pregnant, DeMint was one of the first major conservatives to stand with the Missouri congressman. DeMint even used his political action committee to donate $90,000 to Akins campaign and used its network to raise hundreds of thousands more. We support Todd Akin and hope freedom-loving Americans in Missouri and around the country will join us, DeMints group said.
2. Led the opposition against Obamacare. In 2009, during the height of the GOPs opposition to health care reform, DeMint told a conference call of conservative activists that, If were able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo. It will break him. Ironically, DeMint once supported Mitt Romneys health care reform in Massachusetts, the law on which Obamacare is based. 
3. Wants to prevent gay or unmarried teachers from teaching in public schools. In 2010, DeMint  said if someone is openly homosexual, they shouldnt be teaching in the classroom and he holds the same position on an unmarried woman whos sleeping with her boyfriend — she shouldnt be in the classroom. During his first Senate campaign in 2004, DeMint agreed with the state partys platform barring gay teachers from public schools, claiming that the government shouldnt endorse certain behaviors. 
 4. Pushed a bill outlawing the discussion of abortion over the Internet. Last year, DeMint proposed an amendment to an unrelated bill that would have barred a woman and her doctor from discussing abortion over the internet, even if her health was at risk and tele-conferencing was the most feasible option to receive care.
 5. Wants to strip all federal employees of collective bargaining rights. Though most federal employees dont enjoy the rights and benefits of unionization, DeMint wants to take away even the few bargaining rights they currently enjoy. I dont believe collective bargaining has any place in government, DeMint told ThinkProgress last year.
 6. Blocked creation of the National Womens History Museum. Along with fellow arch-conservative Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), DeMint placed a hold on a 2010 bill to sell land near the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC in order to create the National Womens History Museum. Coburn justified their move to block the museum by noting that there already exist museums for quilters and cowgirls.
 7. Likened striking Chicago teachers to thugs in the Middle East. Speaking at the Values Voters Summit in September 2012, DeMint blasted Chicago teachers who were on strike for a brief period earlier this year. On my way over, I was reading another story about a distant place where thugs had put 400,000 children out in the streets, DeMint said. And then I realized that was a story about the Chicago teachers strike.
 8. Threatened to single-handedly shut down the Senate. In September 2010, DeMint warned his colleagues that he would place a unilateral hold on every single piece of legislation in the Senate, bringing the entire lawmaking process to a grinding halt. Despite being in the minority, DeMint threatened to only allow bills to proceed that his office had personally approved.
 9. Used a failed terrorist plot to attack unions. Following the failed underwear bomber plot in December 2009, DeMint went on Fox News and used the episode as an opportunity to bash unions. I am concerned, because its related to another issue that were dealing with now in the Senate, DeMint said. The administration is intent on unionizing and submitting our airport security to union bosses collective bargaining.
 10. Argued that people with pre-existing conditions got better care before Obamacare. Speaking with ThinkProgress at a Tea Party rally this year, DeMint argued that Obamacare actually hurt people with pre-existing conditions, despite that fact that it bars insurance companies from denying them care. I can guarantee you people with pre-exisitng conditions are going to get less health care—lower quality health care—under Obamacare, DeMint said.
 11. Willing to cause serious disruptions in the economy in order to secure draconian cuts. During last years debt ceiling showdown, DeMint appeared on Fox Business and said that, despite the fact that not raising the debt ceiling would cause serious disruptions, he was willing to do that in order to get major cuts to social programs like Medicare and Social Security.

The sticking point of the negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff has been the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, which Republicans insist must be extended and President Obama and the Democrats insist must end. (Both sides agree on maintaining tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans.) 
Of course, the reason the fiscal cliff is looming in the first place is because of concerns over deficit spending, and the cliff represents a sudden and massive reduction in the size of the countrys budget hole. Not all the fiscal cliffs policy changes arrive at once, but should all of them be enacted, the Congressional Budget Office predicts a new recession over the course of 2013.
The GOPs fiscal cliff offer says nothing about retaining the payroll tax cut or emergency unemployment benefits (EUC), both of which end come January 1. But as the Economic Policy Institute found, extending EUC creates five times as many jobs per dollar of budget deficit as the Bush income tax cuts for the wealthy:
Extending just the upper-income Bush tax cuts would boost GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point, increasing nonfarm payroll employment in 2013 by only 102,000 jobs—far less than one-tenth the impact of continuing the temporary ad hoc stimulus measures. Continuing EUC would do three times as much in terms of GDP growth and support 300,000 to 400,000 jobs. In terms of jobs created per dollar of budget deficit, EUC is more than five times as effective as the Bush income tax cuts for the wealthy. Combine them with the Bush estate tax cuts and they are one-seventh as effective as EUC.

Thats consistent with earlier work from EPI which determined that the expiration of the stimulus measures and the scheduled cuts to government spending were by far the most economically damaging aspects of the fiscal cliff. Meanwhile, the end of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy was far less severe — in fact, in dollar terms their expiration did more to repair the budget than to hurt job growth. CBO came to a very similar conclusion.
Allowing the payroll tax cut to expire would result in $1,000 less take home pay for the average family.

First couples to get licenses in King County (via Joe Mirabella).
Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire (D) certified the states election results Wednesday afternoon, and this morning at 12:01, same-sex couples began legally obtaining marriage licenses. Washington does have a three-day waiting period, however, so the first weddings cannot take place until Sunday. Many couples were on-hand at the King County (Seattle) and Thurston County (Olympia) auditors offices at the stroke of midnight to be among the first to get their licenses.
One of those couples was JP Persall and Diana Wickman, who have been together for 10 years. They both served 22 years in the U.S. Coast Guard, where they managed to meet and fell in love in spite of Dont Ask, Dont Tell. The couple who received the very first marriage license, though, was Jane Abbott Lighty, 77, and Pete-e Peterson, 85, who have been together over 35 years. They met on a blind date in 1977 and believed they would die before they could legally wed.
Also on hand was Dan Savage. He married his husband Terry Miller in Canada in 2005, but decided to use the occasion to renew their vows now that its legal in the state where they live (in the country where they live). Here are a few more pictures from this mornings historic milestone, courtesy of Joe Mirabella:

Last year, the Republican-led Florida legislature slashed the states early voting period in half and cut out voting on the final Sunday before the election — a day when many African American churches turned out parishioners in high numbers. As a result, long lines were the norm for Floridians this year; some even had to wait six hours or more to vote.
After witnessing the negative effects of reducing early voting from 14 days to 8, a number of state lawmakers have introduced legislation to restore those days that had been axed.
State Sens. Arthenia Joyner (D) and Gwen Margolis (D) have pre-filed two bills, SB 80 and SB 82, that would re-institute 14 days of early voting in Florida, beginning on the 15th day before an election and continuing through the Sunday prior to Election Day.
The News Service of Florida has more:
More voting hours also could be available under the bills. Current law requires at least six hours of voting per day, while the bills would require 12 hours per weekday and 12 hours total on the weekend.
In another change proposed by Joyner and Margolis, local supervisors of elections could expand the types of places where early voting is allowed. Currently, supervisors must offer early voting in the supervisors offices, and can allow voting in libraries and city halls. The bills would allow supervisors, if they want, to also offer early voting in other government facilities such as a courthouse, as well as colleges, churches, or community centers. The bills would also prevent counties from reducing the number of early voting sites from what they used in 2008.
Though Republicans control both chambers of the legislature, both incoming Senate President Don Gaetz (R) and incoming House Speaker Will Weatherford (R) have promised that lawmakers will try to figure out what went wrong on Election Day that led to the long lines, and do something about it.

Netflixs attempts to develop original content has frequently been puzzling to me, given its focus on resurrecting dead masterpieces like Arrested Development, remaking masterpieces that dont necessarily translate to new settings like House of Cards, keeping alive shows that no one really believed needed to be kept alive like Terra Nova. But its latest move, to outbid other competitors for Disneys back and future catalogue, actually makes perfect sense to me:
The agreement is the first time one of Hollywoods big studios has chosen Web streaming over pay television. Netflix has made similar output deals with smaller movie suppliers like DreamWorks Animation and the Weinstein Company. But all of the majors — Disney, Paramount, Universal, Warner Brothers, Sony and 20th Century Fox — have stayed with Starz, HBO or Showtime until now.
Library titles like Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas will become available on Netflix immediately, Disney said. Netflix will begin streaming new release Disney films starting in late 2016, when the current accord with Starz expires. The deal announced on Tuesday includes direct-to-DVD movies…With the Disney deal, Netflix will be able to offer customers exclusive access to a pipeline of films that are reliably some of the years biggest box-office successes. Netflix has also made it a priority to strengthen its childrens and family offerings.
Whats smart about this is that its Netflix identifying an actual niche in the market. Hulus done this already in a lot of ways, doubling down on content that will appeal to serious television and film fans, whether its streaming foreign and foreign-language content like Hatufim, historical shows like Ironside, or even films from the Criterion collection. Its true that Hulu is building its audience with a lot of tiny Legos, but the bricks in that wall dont cost them a lot either, and it means they can easily adjust should one of those investments fail to pay off. 
Investing in childrens and family programming is an unsexy way to build a firewall, but its an important one. Parents who want access to content for their children, but are worried about their youngesters wandering elsewhere in the cable lineup, or who dont want to shell out cable prices when they only want some of the content, are a perfect audience for Netflix. And theyre a much clearer audience than whoever Netflix thought it was aiming Lillyhammer at. I dont think its dumb for Netflix to experiment with original content. But until it figures out an actual successful strategy there, it makes much more sense to me for the company to spend $300 million a year on Disney content than for it to spend $100 million on 26 episodes of House of Cards

Earlier this week, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) released a vague counter offer to President Obamas plan to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, offering $800 billion in revenue by closing unspecified loopholes and deductions and $1.4 trillion in spending cuts. Republicans have refused to provide details and have pressed Democrats to detail which cuts they would accept. 
On Wednesday, during an appearance on CNNs Situation Room, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) became speechless when asked to list the spending reductions Congress should adopt, as host Wolf Blitzer pressed the Chairman of the House Republican Conference for just one example. Fellow guest Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA) just threw his hands up in frustration and detailed the $1 trillion plus in cuts Democrats have already supported: 

BLITZER: So, whats the one thing you want Xavier Becerra to agree to, to avoid the fiscal cliff?
McMORRIS RODGERS: We need to have the spending cuts.
BLITZER: What? Give me an example?
McMORRIS RODGERS: Well, it is, its, looking at the spending, looking at entitlement reform, looking at the growth in government. And you know what the President put on the table, the President is moving in the wrong direction. He proposed higher taxes than he ever said during the campaign, more stimulus, more spending, thats moving us in the wrong direction.

Watch it: 

Republicans have been short on examples, though they have repeatedly requested very painful cuts in programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

More than 100 workers died in a garment factory fire on November 24 in Bangladesh. The Dhaka plant, which was making products for Walmart and Sears, had no emergency exits or emergency evacuation procedures. 
But in a meeting last year, Walmart officials decided against agreeing to pay suppliers more so that they could upgrade their manufacturing facilities and pay for the costs of safety improvements. Specifically to the issue of any corrections on electrical and fire safety, we are talking about 4,500 factories, and in most cases very extensive and costly modifications would need to be undertaken to some factories, Walmart officials said in documents obtained by Bloomberg News. It is not financially feasible for the brands to make such investments. 
More than 300 Bangladeshi garment factory workers have died since 2006. Walmart reported a 9 percent increase in third-quarter net income, earning $3.63 billion.

Darden Restaurants, Inc. — owner of Red Lobster and Olive Garden — is battling back negative press attention in light of its October announcement that the company will use Obamacare as a reason to shift to part-time employees.
On Tuesday, the company released a statement revising down its prediction of profits, which led to a huge drop in stocks. Darden attributed the change to the negative attention around its stance on Obamacare, and promised to deal with the health care reform law in ways that work for our employees:
In light of these upcoming changes, we are being cautious about our sales and earnings forecast for the full year, [Dardens Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis] continued.  Our outlook for the year also reflects the potential impact, though difficult to measure, of recent negative media coverage that focused on Darden within the full-service segment and how we might accommodate healthcare reform. [..]
We are also committed to accommodating healthcare reform in ways that work for our employees and guests.  Darden is a strong business which continues to generate solid cash flows that will support appropriate reinvestment in our brands, effective debt management and consistent dividend growth.
Under the Affordable Care Act, any business with 50 more full-time workers is required to offer a health care option to its employees by 2014. If a company chooses not to, and its workers instead seek subsidized care in the public exchanges, the company must pay a penalty. 
Darden is one of several companies threatening to fire employees, switch workers to part time, or freeze hiring because of the health care law. One Applebees franchise owner, the CEO of Papa Johns Pizza, and a Dennys franchise CEO have made similar threats. 
In addition to potentially earning those companies bad press, their complaints about the health reform law are off-base. In reality, Obamacare will, over time, decrease health care costs. It will also likely lead to more satisfied workers, competitive hiring, and higher rate of employee retention.
Update  AP is reporting that, in an effort to stem the negative attention, Darden will announce Thursday that they will not be moving any workers to a part-time schedule because of Obamacare. The company is, however, keeping the option open of relying more heavily on part-time employees in the future. Ultimately, reports a Darden spokesman, they tested a shift to part-time staff and found a decline in satisfaction all around:
After Dardens tests were reported in October, the company received a flood of feedback from customers through its website, on Facebook and in restaurants, said Bob McAdam, who heads government affairs and community relations for Darden. Additionally, he said that internal surveys showed both employee and customer satisfaction declined at restaurants where the tests were in place.
What that taught us is that our restaurants perform better when we have full-time hourly employees involved, he said… McAdam declined to give specifics on the internal surveys but said the decline was enough to make a decision.

Wisconsin Speaker-elect Robin Vos (R)The Wisconsin state constitution forbids nearly all laws that restrict the franchise. In its words, [e]very United States citizen age 18 or older who is a resident of an election district in this state is a qualified elector of that district. This is why two Wisconsin courts struck down that states voter ID law, and it is why 132 years of Wisconsin Supreme Court precedent forbid voter suppression laws such as voter ID.
Wisconsin state Rep. Robin Vos (R), who will serve as Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly next year, thinks such robust protection of the right to vote is a problem — and its a problem hes wants to solve:
VOS: I do think that having photo ID is something that is broadly supported by the public. Its something that I really hope we have in place by the next general election. If there were some serious issues raised by the Dane County court Im looking to fix those, but ultimately I want to make sure photo ID is the law of Wisconsin.
QUESTION: Very briefly, would you favor beginning the process of changing the states constitution to require photo ID because of some of the legal uncertainty around the law?
VOS: Yes, I would favor that. It also takes two sessions, so that wouldnt be until 2015 even if we did begin that process. Hopefully we can get a statute passed that will be in effect for the 2014 election or sooner.
Watch it:

In the same interview, Vos also endorsed a proposal by Gov. Scott Walker (R-WI) to make it harder to vote by eliminating same-day voter registration.
For the record, voter ID laws do not simply violate the Wisconsin Constitution, they also violate the U.S. Constitution. As the Supreme Court explained in Burdick v. Takushi, laws that place a high burden on voters in order to address a particularly weak state interest are unconstitutional. Voter ID laws potentially disenfranchise thousands of voters; and though their supporters attempt to justify them by claiming that they are necessary to prevent voter fraud, the truth is that a person is more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit voter fraud at the polls. One study of Wisconsin voters determined that just 0.00023 percent of votes are the product of in-person fraud.
Nevertheless, in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board the Roberts Court refused to strike down an unconstitutional voter ID law. If President Obama has an opportunity to replace one of the Courts conservatives, correcting the error in Crawford should be a top priority.

Citigroup announced on Wednesday that it will cut 11,000 jobs, or 4 percent of its workforce, in an effort to trim expenses. 
The moves comes one month after Citigroup paid out nearly $14 million to two former executives, CEO Vikram Pandit and Chief Operating Officer John Havens, who were ousted for poor management. The Citigroup board forced Pandit out, after a series of missteps this year left some directors feeling that the company wasnt being managed effectively and that the board wasnt kept adequately informed. 
Under Pandit and Havens, Citigroup lost 88 percent of its stock value. Still, the executives walked away with generous pay packages: 
Vikram Pandit, Citigroup Inc. (C)s ousted chief executive officer, will get about $6.7 million in 2012 compensation and will forfeit some awards tied to a $40 million retention package granted last year.
John Havens, who resigned last month as Citigroups chief operating officer on the same day as Pandit, will get about $6.8 million for 2012 and also forfeit some awards, the New York- based lender said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Citigroup is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets.
Based on the progress this year through the date of separation, the board determined that an incentive award for their work in 2012 was appropriate and equitable, Chairman Michael E. ONeill said in the filing.

It is something of a trend for corporations to pay top executives high salaries, while employees feel the consequences of a struggling company. After failed Twinkie-maker Hostess declared bankruptcy, it cut workers pay 8 percent, but left the CEOs $1.5 million salary untouched.

Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R)
Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R), the state Republican Partys apparent choice for governor in 2013, claims he is best known for his efforts to preserve liberty and defend the Constitution. But in 2005, he used his position as a state Senator to try to censor a university sexual education event he felt was pushing a pro-sex agenda and an anything goes agenda.
In 2005, a pro-choice student group at George Mason University organized its inaugural Sextravaganza event — a campus sexuality and health fair aimed at teaching attendees about practicing safer sex and preventing unplanned pregnancy. For this event, the group organized 15 booths to provide information on abstinence, condoms and self-help exams, as well as sexual orientation. An array of views were presented to approximately 500 attendees: a minister from the Campus Catholic Ministry staffed one of the tables promoting abstinence and opposing abortion, while others promoted abortion rights and provided information about safer sex.
Sen. Cuccinelli, however, was outraged that his alma mater — a public state university — would host an event he believed really just designed to push sex and sexual libertine behavior as far, fast and furiously as possibly. Among Cuccinellis objections to the event:

Upset that information about sexuality — other than abstinence only — would be presented to adult college students, he said it was symptomatic of the moral depravity that has crept across this commonwealth and this country.
Upset that the event was sponsored by the Pro-Choice Patriots, he said, Theyre selling their product. They are selling abortions.
Upset that the GMU Pride Alliance presented information on sexual orientation, he said, You cant have safe homosexual sex. There is no such thing and yet one of the sponsoring groups is the homosexual group on campus.
Upset about an (ultimately scrapped) plan to raffle off sex toys at the fair, he said the event would push every form of sexual promiscuity there is out there.
Upset that some of the advertising for the event was paid for out of student activity fees, he said, This is a how-to fun fair for sex. This isnt education. This is pushing sex. Its encouraging it… It doesnt swell me with pride to see my alma mater putting on a soft porn show.
Upset that aphrodisiacs including Hersheys Kisses, cucumber slices, strawberry Jello-O, and oyster crackers were given out at the event, Cuccinelli, Black, and three other Republican legislators wrote to the GMUs president, We appropriated $33.1 million in FY 2005 to treat STDs and AIDS. We are concerned that the frivolous manner in which human sexuality is being treated here with GMU approval is counter productive to the best interests of Virginia citizens.
Upset that presenters encouraged attendees to properly use condoms to protect themselves, he took use with that term, calling it factually incorrect, because condoms do not stop HPV or Herpes.
Upset that attendees were invited to lobby for increased federal funding to fight sexually transmitted diseases, he dismissed the idea that funding offers any kind of solution to the significant consequences of voluntary behavior.

Cuccinelli maintained the event would disgrace the school, warning that Virginia government might need to establish some statewide standards to prevent this and similar events at other public colleges and universities. But the universitys administration  emphatically rejected suggestions from Cuccinelli and then state-Delegate Dick Black (R) that they cancel the event.  The chief of staff to the president of GMU called Sextravaganza 2005 as well an organized and delivered student event as weve had on campus, and it was repeated in future years.
How did Cuccinelli square his efforts to censor the event with his professed desire to preserve liberty?  He told Bacons Rebellion, a Virginia blog, in the realm of morality, freedom is not the right to do whatever you want (license), it is, in fact, the ability to do as you ought (self control).

Since President Obamas re-election, Republicans have distanced themselves from Mitt Romney and sought to revamp their brand, calling for immigration reform and more more moderate positions on womens health and reproductive rights. Some top Republican advisers even pressed the party to address the core issue of middle class economics with innovative ideas. 
But policy makers have been reticent to moderate their proposals, ignoring voters support for key aspects of President Obamas agenda. House Speaker John Boehners (R-OH) opening offer to address the so-called fiscal cliff mirrored his 2011 position and Romneys plan to find new revenue by closing tax loopholes and deductions. Congressional Republicans advanced an immigration bill they defeated before the election and won little praise from Hispanics, who criticized the measure for limiting legal immigration.
And on Tuesday night, at the Jack Kemp Foundation Leadership Award Dinner, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who is seen as the future of the Republican Party and a potential presidential candidate, sought to lay out a blueprint for the party moving forward. But he too reached for the policies of the past to lay the road to 2016, echoing policies Romney proposed, campaigned, and ultimately lost on. Here is a comparison:



 
The New GOP
Is The Same As The Old GOP


TAX REFORM
RUBIO: We should keep rates low on everyone…Simplify our tax code by getting rid of unjustified loopholes. And generate new revenue by creating new taxpayers, not new taxes. 
ROMNEY: There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code and create incentives for growth.


EDUCATION
RUBIO: We need to allow charter schools and other innovative schools to flourish. The key to that is empowering parents. Parents should be the ultimate decision makers on where their children go to school… All our parents should be able to send their children to the school of their choice.
ROMNEY: For the first time in history, federal education funds will be linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school, or to a private school, where permitted…To receive the full complement of federal education dollars, states must provide students with ample school choice.


GOVERNMENT
RUBIO: Big government is not effective government. Big government has never worked. The promise of more government as the answer to all our problems is easy to sell. But when it is put in practice, it fails every time.
ROMNEY: What were seeing right now is, in my view, a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And its not working.


HEALTH CARE
 RUBIO: People should be able to buy a health care plan that fits their needs and budget, from any company in America that is willing to sell it to them.
ROMNEY: Id just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. Id rather be able to have an insurance company. If I dont like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice.


ENERGY
RUBIO: American innovation has now given us access to massive new deposits of oil and natural gas, making America the most energy rich country on the planet. 
ROMNEY: America is blessed with extraordinary natural resources, and developing them will create millions of good jobs – not only in the energy industry, but also in industries like manufacturing that will benefit from more energy at lower prices.

The late Christopher Hitchens article in Vanity Fair arguing that women arent funny has done a lot of harm over the years, lending pedigreed intellectual credence to an argument made by lots of incredibly dumb comedians and commentators everywhere. But one useful thing the response to the piece has accomplished is to push Vanity Fair to do somewhat better at covering female comedians. There was the 2008 feature Who Says Women Arent Funny? The What Tina Wants profile of Tina Fey from 2009. And now, even better than separating out female comedians from the pack, the magazine is doing its first ever comedy issue, putting female comedians, including non-white ones and non-tiny ones, on three separate, great-looking covers.
And even more than that, its published an interesting poll, conducted through CBS facilities, of 1,132 adults, that suggest some revealing things about how audiences view comedy. More men than women think sexual assault is the one topic theyd most like to see comedians put off-limits: it was the choice of 38 percent of men, and 32 percent of women, ahead of September 11, the sick and disabled, and religious figures. The second most-popular response for women, at 28 percent, was all of them, the choice of only 14 percent of men. So maybe women do have a sensitive streak when it comes to humor generally. But among everyone else, men may be just as uncomfortable with bad jokes about sexual assault as women are, even if they arent as vocal about it. Comedians who assume theyre on safe ground in mostly-male audiences might want to check their set lists twice.
Both men and women in the survey think men are funnier than women—65 percent of men said male comedians were funnier and 54 percent of women agreed. 30 percent of women said women were funnier, compared to just 13 percent of men. And 18 percent of men and 12 percent of women said that there was no difference. Some of this may just be a result of who men and women see being funny in our media environment: there are a lot more extremely famous male stand-ups than women, and more male sitcom stars than female sitcom stars. Or maybe its Hitchens, and Adam Carolla, and everyone else. But that perception does suggest that women going into the comedy business face some hurdles in convincing audiences that they can be just as funny as men.
Id recommend taking the survey with a grain of salt—after all, its best sitcom of all time question didnt even offer up the option of I Love Lucy. But its still nice, in a debate that is on a lot of levels completely and utterly ridiculous, to see an organization that has a record of Not Helping, at least pulling together a little data that can help us have more productive conversations.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) turned heads last month when he told GQ Magazine that he didnt know the age of the earth and sparked speculation that he is laying a foundation for a 2016 presidential run. Im not sure well ever be able to answer that. Its one of the great mysteries, he insisted.
But on Wednesday Rubio walked back his remarks, telling Politicos Mike Allen that he could have given a better answer, a more succinct answer. The Florida senator said he recognized that scientists agree that the earth is at least 4.5 billion years old and explained that this belief is not inconsistent with his faith. He also claimed that his answer is similar to how then-presidential candidate Barack Obama replied to the question in 2007. Here is Rubio: 

RUBIO: There is no scientific debate on the age of the earth. I mean, its established pretty definitively, its at least 4.5 billion years old. I was referring to a theological debate, which is a pretty health debate. And the theological debate is … how do you reconcile with what science has definitively established with what you may think your faith teaches. Now for me, actually, when it comes to the age of the earth, there is no conflict. I believe that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And I think that scientific advances have given us insight into when he did it and how he did it, but I still believe God did it…. I just think in America we should have the freedom to teach our children whatever it is we believe. And that means teaching them science, they have to know the science, but also parents have the right to teach them the theology and to reconcile the two things.
Watch it: 

My faith teaches that [the earth being 4.5 billion years old] is not inconsistant. God created the universe. In the beginning, out of nothing, God created heavens and the earth, he said. The more science learns, the more Im convinced that God is real.

 Though Indiana state senator Dennis Kruse (R) failed to pass his measure requiring schools to teach creationism alongside evolution, he hasnt given up. Rather than another attempt at the creationist bill, Kruse, the chairman of Indianas Senate Education and Career Development Committee, plans to offer truth in education legislation. 
The truth in education bill wont mention religion, God, or Adam and Eve. Instead, the bill vaguely suggests that students challenge teachers and make them prove the truth. As Kruses colleague, Sen. Tim Skinner (D-IN), pointed out, this bill describes the basic interaction of teacher and student:
If youre teaching something, then a student could question that and say, you know, ‘How do you know thats true? And so the teacher would have to come up with different sources, ‘This is why I think this is true, Kruse says.
Terre Haute Democratic Senator Tim Skinner says Kruses proposal is not something that needs to be mandated.
If Senator Kruse had education experience he would know that students across the country are already doing that every day in the public school classroom, Skinner says. They question everything, and I think a teacher whos actually doing their job will answer those questions.

Kruses bill is similar to a Tennessee bill that was passed in April, which encourages students to question teachers on science and protects teachers from retribution if they choose to teach creationism. His former legislation was killed in the House, as House Speaker Brian Bosma (R-IN) believed it would result in costly legal battles. The creationist movement suffered a defeat in the courts last week, when a Louisiana judge decreed that Gov. Bobby Jindals (R-LA) program to give huge sums of taxpayer dollars to religious private schools that teach anti-evolution theories was unconstitutional.

As Congress mulls changes to an outdated law intended to protect electronic privacy, a group of law enforcement officers is lobbying for a provision that would erode privacy by requiring that text messages be saved and stored for at least two years. According to CNET, police and prosecutors groups say they have increasingly come to rely on text messages as evidence in criminal cases, and they are vying for a mandated storage period for wireless providers in amendments to the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act now being considered:
[T]he Senate Judiciary committee … approved sweeping amendments to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act last week. Unlike earlier drafts, the latest one veers in a very privacy-protective direction by requiring police to obtain a warrant to read the contents of e-mail messages; the SMS push by law enforcement appears to be a way to make sure it includes one of their priorities too.
It wasnt immediately clear whether the law enforcement proposal is to store the contents of SMS messages, or only the metadata such as the sender and receiver phone numbers associated with the messages. Either way, its a heap of data: Forrester Research reports that more than 2 trillion SMS messages were sent in the U.S. last year, over 6 billion SMS messages a day.
Among the groups urging the mandate are the Mayor Cities Police Chiefs Association, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Sheriffs Association, and the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies. These agencies are not alone in vying for more data collection and retention. The Department of Justice last year called for laws requiring Internet providers to retain data. But the American Civil Liberties Unions Christopher Calabrese points out that any such proposal certainly doesnt belong in discussions on reform of the law intended to protect electronic privacy.
Evidence suggests that wireless carriers have a range of evolving policies on retaining text messages, from no retention at all to 180 days. Most companies, however, appear not to have policies that messages be stored for a time period even close to two years. A spokesman for U.S. Cellular told CNET that data is stored for just 3-5 days, due to the volume of the content.
Both wireless companies and law enforcement agencies do increasingly store and monitor other kinds of phone data. The New York City Police Department is retaining cell phone logs collected when phones are reported stolen, and other wireless carriers recently reported fielding 1.3 million law enforcement requests last year for various types of data.

The Huffington Posts Ryan Grim reported Tuesday that Sen.-elect Elizabeth Warren, a dogged consumer advocate whose critique of Wall Street excess was a centerpiece of her campaign, will join the Senate Banking Committee. Wall Street spent boatloads of money to prevent Warrens election, but now, as the Center for Responsive Politics noted, she will have oversight of the rules and regulations under which banks operate:
The securities and investments industry contributed just $245,000 to Warren and spent $3 million supporting her opponent Scott Brown, according to OpenSecrets data from mid-October. The industry was Browns top supporter. 
The Financial/Insurance/Real Estate sector followed suit and contributed $6 million to Brown and a puny half-a-million to Warren. Businesses also favored Brown heavily, and his top contributors came straight from Wall Street. And though there wasnt much outside spending in the race because of a pledge made by the two candidates, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, whose members include business and financial interests, spent $400,000 on the race in support of Brown and against Warren.
Several Senate candidates supported by Wall Street wound up losing. As a member of the Banking Committee, Warren will have the opportunity to stand against both the watering down of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and new misguided efforts to reduce limits on Wall Street.

 New Orleans residents Mohammed and Talat Husain claim they were refused service at Rep. John Flemings (R-LA) Subway franchise in Shreveport, Louisiana. According to Husain, an employee of the chain told them to leave because they are Muslim and threw them out after an altercation. Though Husain called the police, a report was never filed. He recounted the experience to TPM:
She asked me point blank ‘Are you Muslim? and I said, ‘Yes, Im Muslim, She said ‘We cant serve you and locked the door from inside when my wife was still inside the store, Husain said.
The situation quickly escalated and Husain ended up calling 911. So did a Subway employee. At some point before police arrived, however Husain said the employee unlocked the door and let his wife leave but also made it clear they should take their business elsewhere.
An officer with the Shreveport Police Department arrived after that. Both Husain and a department spokesman said the officer initially patted Husain down to check for weapons. But spokesman Cpl. Marcus Hines said the officer eventually determined the situation was much ado about nothing. Department records show the officer didnt even file a report.

Flemings employees deny Husains version of events, and claim that security tapes prove that there was no discrimination against the couple. Still, the Shreveport police are ignoring a request for an investigation by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Fleming, a devout Christian, warned in August that the election was a choice between competing world views of a godless society or a Christian nation.

Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi (R)
Last year, Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi (R) was one of the leading proponents of a plan to rig the Electoral College for Mitt Romney by allocating the states electoral votes by congressional district rather than awarding them to the overall winner of the state. Had Pileggis election-rigging proposal been in effect last month, Romney would have likely received 13 of Pennsylvanias 20 electoral votes, despite losing the state by more than 5 percentage points. The election rigging plan eventually died, however, due to concerns from House Republicans that it might cause the Obama campaign to shift resources to their districts and cost them their seats.
Pileggi is not giving up, however, and hes now backing a slightly modified scheme to rig the 2016 election for Republicans:
Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi says frustrated Pennsylvania supporters of Mitt Romney deserve a more equitable way of counting presidential votes. Hes pushing once again to break up the states electoral college vote.
But instead of determining the votes by congressional district, they would be allocated according to percentage of the popular vote, plus two for the statewide winner. . . . Under that system, Barack Obama would have won 12 of Pa.s electoral college votes and 8 for Romney. Thats a net advantage of 4 EC votes for Obama versus the net 20 advantage Pa. gave him on election day.
The reason for this proposal is clear. Pennsylvania is a blue state that voted for the Democratic candidate in every single presidential race for the last two decades. So Pileggis plan is nothing more than a proposal to steal electoral votes that are overwhelmingly likely to be awarded to the Democratic candidate under the current system and give them away to the Republican candidate.

Forty nine percent of Republicans believe that President Obama won reelection thanks to the allegedly illegal work of a group that no longer exists, according to a Public Policy Polling survey. 
The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) was at the center of anti-Obama energy in 2008, when Republicans cited some faulty registration forms obtained by ACORN as proof of voter fraud. The charge was particularly potent, since Obama hired one of the organizations associated with ACORN to run voter turnout for him in the primary. 
But in 2010, ACORN filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, putting an end to the community organizing effort altogether. Still, the fact that ACORN no longer exists hasnt stopped the group from serving its role as scapegoat. Fifty two percent of Republicans blamed ACORN for Obamas win in 2008, saying that they stole the election for him. That number only dropped by 3 percent, and 49 percent blame ACORN this time around.

Ohio Senator Rob Portman (R) was one of a handful of Washington, D.C lawmakers and policy experts invited to participate in a panel discussion on the fiscal cliff on Tuesday morning, but his prepared remarks were temporarily derailed by about a dozen protestors who stood up, one at a time, to confront Portman over his support for the Republican plan to cut billions from social programs and entitlements that millions of low-income and middle class Americans rely on. 
For five minutes, individuals scattered throughout the audience interrupted Portman to ask him not to cut programs like Medicare and Social Security or spending on teachers and other public employees. Several of them identified themselves as his constituents, to which Portman responded by promising them an audience following his remarks. The confrontations, though coordinated, harkened back to last spring, when Republicans returned home to their districts only to find themselves face to face with angry voters who voiced their displeasure at the Republicans budget plan of deep cuts and no increases in revenue.
Portman was invited to speak by a group calling itself Fix The Debt, a collection of corporate CEOs who are advocating cuts to entitlement programs while simultaneously pushing for more than $100 billion in tax breaks for themselves and their companies. 
Watch the protests:

Things only got more tense once the protestors were escorted from the room. The cameraman captured Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow from the Heritage Foundation, shouting angrily at the crowd, and it appears that another individual tried to grab the camera before the footage cuts off.

Its that time of year when Fox News and other conservative media outlets revive their imaginary War on Christmas. But the actual threat to one Christmas tradition comes from something more insidious than Foxs perceived attacks: Extreme drought, fueled by climate change, has hit the Christmas tree market.
2012′s relentless drought will likely last through the rest of the winter, at least in the midwest, as areas under severe drought expanded in November. Right now, 63 percent of the lower 48 states are experiencing drought conditions:

The prolonged drought has hurt the growth of newly planted trees, which take years six to 12 years to reach full height. The more mature trees have developed root systems to survive little water, meaning growers expect normal supply for the holiday season. Since the youngest trees lack enough water to develop their roots,  they die off quickly. 
The Star Tribune writes that in Minnesota, the dry late summer and fall killed many young trees — perhaps 40 percent, said Will Almendinger, owner of Rum River Tree Farm in Anoka County. In other parts of the Midwest, it appears to have taken all of them, said Bert Cregg, a Michigan State University horticulture professor. Much of Oklahoma, for example, is under exception drought, experiencing its seventh-driest year on record. At the same time, Oklahomas tree farms have dwindled in number. Minnesota farmers worry about tree supply in years to come, after two exceptionally dry and hot summers. 
One study after another shows that the U.S. will only face increasingly severe, frequent droughts, with global warming as the culprit.
The worst drought in 50 years has had a surprising impact on more than just Christmas. Food banks announced before Thanksgiving that the drought is shrinking government food donations.

The Times of London reports that several American churches are now offering concealed firearms training in order to attract worshipers to their pews. One of these churches, Heights Baptist in San Angelo, Texas offers a particularly unusual reason why they are now training their parishioners to pack heat — in order to prevent worship services from being disrupted by armed Mexicans:
In Texas, where its legal to carry guns into any church without a specific no-firearms policy, Heights Baptist in remote San Angelo began offering concealed carry classes in June. The class was a response to security concerns among congregants.
Were about 150 miles from the border with Mexico and were very unsure about our insecure borders — about whats coming into our cities, Pastor James Miller told NRA News. Personally, I feel more secure that should our worship time be interrupted by a life-threatening intrusion, that we would at least stand some kind of a chance in stopping either a mass killing or terrorizing experience.
Miller also claims there is a spiritual component to carrying a Glock hidden beneath your Sunday best: Jesus advises his disciples to sell their cloak and buy a sword. He instructed his people to be prepared to defend themselves.

Rep. John Boehners (R-OH) proposal to avert the so-called ‘fiscal cliff is far from moderate: He refuses to consider taxing millionaires, he wants to raise the payroll tax, and his plan to raise revenue is similar to the detail-free ideas of former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. On top of all that, the namesake of his plan — economics heavyweight Erskine Bowles — rejected the title, saying that the plan wasnt centrist enough. 
But that isnt stopping some far-right organizations and members of Congress from rejecting the proposal. A few Republicans have come out against the Boehner plan, either as an attempt to try to make the Speaker look moderate when hes not, or as a way of evincing a personal vendetta. Here are four Republicans calling Boehners plan a cave on the fiscal showdown:
Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS): The freshman Congressman from Kansas might be harboring some personal feelings against GOP leadership right now: Huelskamp was just taken off of the budget committee for having opposed leadership too many times. Hes speaking out against leadership Republicans, saying they only give lip service to conservative principles. 
Americans for Prosperity Preisdent Tim Phillips: The point of an advocacy organization is to push their own agenda, and AFP has been vocal about theirs: To stop Democrats from raising any taxes, and to cut back on social safety net spending. Phillips trashed Boehners plan in an interview with National Journal, saying Sadly, this plan leaves conservatives wanting.
Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC): As a tea party standard-bearer, DeMint may be trying to push Boehner as far to the right as possible by calling out his plan on Twitter. Its also possible the Senator was feigning outrage, an easy way to paint Boehner as reasonable. Speaker Boehners offer of an $800 billion tax hike will destroy jobs and allow politicians in Washington to spend even more, he wrote. 
The Heritage Foundation: According to National Journal, the advocacy arm of the Heritage Foundation sent its members an email disparaging Boehners plan: Not only are Republican leaders asking their members to go back on their promise not to raise taxes on the American people, the email reads, but they appear unwilling to fight for the bold entitlement reforms that won them the House in 2010.
In fact, theres no compromise in Boehners plan at all, just a vague promise to find a method of increasing revenue. It cuts deeply from social programs while sparing top earners from any additional taxes. Indeed, every potential olive branch extended by Republicans has been nothing more than a bait and switch, signaling to the public that Republicans are willing to play a fair game, but without any actual proposals to go along with the gesture.

Rumors that film star Ashley Judd is considering a run for Senate in her native Kentucky are solidifying. Politico reported Tuesday that Judd has spoken to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and a Democratic pollster about a possible challenge to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Judd, an unabashed progressive activist, attended the Democratic National Convention this year as a delegate from Tennessee, where she currently lives. Should she decide to run, it wont be difficult to determine where she stands on crucial policy issues. Here are just a few examples:

Womens health. Judd has been an outspoken advocate for womens health groups NARAL Pro-Choice and Planned Parenthood. As she marveled in May, Its remarkable to me that I would be having conversations with my peers and the younger cohort about access to reproductive health. Thats the same conversation I have with girls and women in Bangladesh. Its the same conversation I have in Cambodia and Madagascar. And here we are in America in 2010, talking about whether or not modern family planning is useful. I mean I find that extraordinary.

Equal pay for women. The film star has talked many times about the importance of equal pay legislation such as the Lilly Ledbetter Act:
Greatest stimulus for economy, EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN. Would add 200 B to our economy. He does not support Pay Check Fairness/Lily Ledbetter.
— ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) October 17, 2012

Fighting the coal industry. The eighth-generation Kentucky native spoke at a rally against mountaintop removal coal-mining, calling it a scourge and a tragedy that has devastated the states natural resources:

Climate change. Judd is firmly against off-shore oil drilling and testified to a House subcomittee on the benefits of cap and trade legislation. She noted on the red carpet that she specifically supports, designating 5 percent of the revenue generated by cap and trade to help ameliorate and offset the damage global climate change is doing to different environmental systems.

Equal marriage rights. Judd praised President Obama at the DNC for embracing same-sex marriage rights, saying she was extremely proud because he was displaying his values and his belief in equality.
Obamacare. At the DNC she extolled the Affordable Care Act as having helped 350,000 Tennessean families with pre-existing conditions, while 60,000 young people are now covered under their parents insurance.

Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.
These boldly liberal stances may not help the star win over deep-red Kentucky, and she is not likely to compromise them. As her own grandmother said, Shes a Hollywood liberal. It would be interesting to see what type of race she would run.

Political consultant Bob Shrum gave Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) a lesson in post-election politics on CNN Tuesday morning, when Shrum told the Senator to give up the dream of repealing Obamacare. 
In the middle of a heated discussion about the fiscal showdown, CNN host Soledad OBrien asked Johnson to give examples of what kind of spending cuts should be on the table. Johnson put the Presidents signature health care reform law at the top of his list, saying that it costs more than people realize. Not going to happen, Shrum told Johnson, You lost the election, buddy:
JOHNSON: Lets acknowledge that the primary driver of our debt and deficit is going to be health care costs.  And we have a whole new entitlement — by the way, weve already got a trillion dollars of middle class, middle income tax increases cooked into the books under Obamacare. [...]
SHRUM: This is fantasy land. Its like saying Ronald Reagan invented the Apple iPad. Obamacare is not going to be on the table. [...]
JOHNSON: Zero to 610 is the vote total of the last three votes on [Obamas] last two budgets. Zero to 610. Do you think thats a serious proposal? Heres the bottom line: President Obama, show us a plan.
SHRUM: He cant show you a plan. He gave you a plan, and his plan is not to repeal Obamacare. Not going to happen. You lost the election, buddy. 
Watch it:

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also proposed putting Obamacare cuts on the table. But if the goal of the fiscal showdown is to reduce the deficit, then Republicans seem to be taking the wrong approach: The Congressional Budget Office calculates that the health care law already reduces the deficit by billions of dollars in the next decade, and, in the decade after that, by more than $1 trillion.

Throughout the fiscal cliff negotiations Republicans have insisted on preserving tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of Americans, but have dogmatically opposed maintaing a payroll tax holiday that disproportionately benefits the middle class. Payroll taxes fall harder on those lower down the income ladder and economists believe that allowing 2011′s 2-percent decrease to expire could undermine economic growth, while permitting the top rates to go up would have only minimal impact. 
On Tuesday morning, during an appearance on SiriusXMs POTUS Politics, Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) argued that raising marginal rates on the very rich would slow-down job creation but insisted that the nations debt problem requires the government to allow the payroll tax holiday to expire. Price said that individuals — presumably those who benefit most from the holiday — must feel more pain to help set the country on a sound fiscal footing: 

TIM FARLEY (HOST): The payroll tax holiday is likely going away. People will likely get that increase in the deduction from your pay as of January 15, youll see your first paycheck, 2 percent will be gone. And I wonder if, even if you come to a solution…people are going to look at their paychecks and say, ‘I thought we solved this and look at all this money being taken out of my paycheck. 
PRICE: Well, remember, step back and recognize that weve had four straight years of trillion dollar plus deficits, were $16 trillion plus dollars in debt. This doesnt get fixed without some pain for everybody…The remarkable challenge that we have requires more work and more diligence and more pain for more individuals.

Listen: 

Recent nonpartisan studies have shown that the Bush tax cuts for the rich — those on income above $250,000 — dont boost the economy, while providing relief to lower and middle class Americans could significantly speed up the recovery. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for instance, Extending both the current 2 percentage-point cut in the payroll tax and emergency unemployment benefits…would boost real GDP by about three-quarters of a percent by the end of 2013.
But unfortunately, the GOP is more interested in ideologically-driven policies that shrink government — and make very painful cuts to benefits — than growing the economy.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court provided some comfort to those fearing the seemingly limitless potential of new technologies to enable government privacy invasion. In holding that police could not attach a GPS device to a car and track it for 30 days without a warrant, the court said, At bottom, we must ‘assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.
But dont get too comfortable. A federal appeals court ruled last week that police can secretly videotape a suspects home without a warrant. In a case about the suspected sale of bald eagle feathers and pelts – a misdemeanor crime — the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that undercover police admitted into the suspects home as interested buyers of pelts did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they secretly videotaped the suspects home:
We are persuaded that it is not constitutionally relevant whether an informant utilizes an audio-video device, rather than merely an audio recording device, to record activities occurring inside a home, into which the informer has been invited. When Wahchumwah invited Agent Romero into his home, he forfeited his expectation of privacy as to those areas that were knowingly expose[d] to Agent Romero. Wahchumwah cannot reasonably argue that the recording violates his legitimate privacy interests when it reveals no more than what was already visible to the agent.
The decision doesnt entirely break new ground. At least one other federal appeals court has upheld the use of video recordings inside the home, and just last month, a lower federal court reached a similar conclusion.
But the case raises the same sorts of concerns that several concurring justices emphasized in the U.S. Supreme Courts decision last term in United States v. Jones: What scope of surveillance will not violate our present understanding of a reasonable expectation of privacy? At what point are we, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor cautions in Jones, making available at a relatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate information about any person whom the Government, in its unfettered discretion, chooses to track, may ‘alter the relationship between citizen and government in a way that is inimical to democratic society? Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Hanni Fakhoury elaborates on this concern:
[T]he sad truth is that as technology continues to advance, surveillance becomes voluntary only by virtue of the fact we live in a modern society where technology is becoming cheaper, easier and more invasive. The Wahchumwah case exemplifies this: on suspicion of nothing more than the benign misdemeanor of selling eagle feathers, the government got to intrude inside the home and record every intimate detail it could: books on a shelf, letters on a coffee table, pictures on a wall. And were entering an age where criminal suspicion is no longer even necessary. Whether youre calling a friends stolen cell phone and landing on the NYPD massive database of call logs, driving into one of the increasing number of cities using licenseplatescanners to record who comes in or out, or walking somewhere close to hovering drones, innocent people are running the risk of having their personal details stored in criminal databases for years to come.
The fractured majority in United States v. Jones didnt provide much guidance about where the court will draw future lines on surveillance, relying instead upon the fact that the Jones case involved a physical trespass — a type of privacy violation of particular constitutional concern. Of course, the Ninth Circuit case involved a physical intrusion in the place subject to the greatest Fourth Amendment protection – the home. Whether it became something other than a trespass — and sufficient grounds to authorize invasive surveillance – because the suspect unknowingly admitted the undercover officer into his home is another question that may be for ripe for Supreme Court consideration.

After spending weeks insisting that they dont need to release additional details for a proposal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, House Republicans publicized a counter offer to President Obamas plan on Monday. The plan is similar to the vague outline Mitt Romney proposed during the election and offers few specifics as to how Republicans aim to raise the revenue theyve promised. 
The $2.2 trillion blueprint extends Bush tax cuts for all Americans, including the wealthiest two percent, but finds $800 billion in revenue from tax reform by limiting or closing unspecified tax loopholes, deductions, and lowering tax rates. Significantly, the higher revenues will be identified by the relevant House committees next year, and will not be included in the immediate down payment. The plan also enacts an array of mandatory and discretionary spending cuts: 

– $600 billion in health savings, including raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. 
– $300 billion from savings in other mandatory programs.
– $200 billion by applying a less generous measure of inflation to Social Security and Medicare benefits. 
– $300 billion in cuts to agency budgets.

In a letter to President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) reiterated the GOPs support for Rep. Paul Ryans (R-WI) reforms to Medicare and Medicaid, which would shift health care costs to seniors and lower-income Americans. The letter does not, mention raising the debt ceiling — for which Boehner has pledged to extract a concession — extending the payroll tax cut or unemployment benefits. 
Update   The White House rejects the plan: 
The Republican letter released today does not meet the test of balance. In fact, it actually promises to lower rates for the wealthy and sticks the middle class with the bill. Their plan includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve. Independent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires. 

Update   Boehners plan would also allow the payroll tax reduction to expire. 
Update   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has announced that Democrats will file a discharge petition, to force a vote on extending the middle income tax cut, on Tuesday at noon.

Immediately after the suicide of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher, who police say murdered his girlfriend at their home before driving to the Chiefs practice facility and shooting himself in front of the teams coach and general manager, thoughts turned to the role concussions and brain injuries may have played in the tragedy. 
But during halftime of last nights Sunday Night Football broadcast, NBCs Bob Costas brought up another angle: the role guns, and our nations lax gun laws, played in the tragedy. After a brief introduction, Costas quoted Kansas City-based columnist Jason Whitlock, who wrote yesterday that he believed both Belcher and his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, would be alive today were it not for Belchers possession of a gun:
‘Our current gun culture, Whitlock wrote, ‘ensures that more and more domestic disputes will end in the ultimate tragedy. And more convenience store confrontations over loud music coming from a car will leave more teenage boys bloodied and dead. Handguns do not enhance our safety. They exacerbate our flaws, tempt us to escalate arguments and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it. In the coming days, Jovan Belchers actions and their possible connection to football will be analyzed. Who knows?  But here, wrote Jason Whitlock, ‘is what I believe — if Jovan Belcher didnt possess a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today.

Conservatives and gun advocates are, of course, angry at Costas insinuation, via Whitlock, that gun control could have prevented the murder of Kasandra Perkins. Fox & Friends blasted Costas this morning, with co-host Brian Kilmeade relying on the tried-and-true point that follows every outbreak of gun violence this country has. I just dont know if its appropriate enough on a Sunday night, less than 24 hours after this guy took his own life and killed his girlfriend and the mother of his baby, to make that stance, Kilmeade said. I dont think we needed to hear that last night.
When, then, is the appropriate time to talk about gun violence? According to gun advocates, it wasnt after another black teenager was shot in a parking lot because he was listening to loud music. It wasnt after another mass murder at one of our schools, shopping malls, or movie theaters. It wasnt in a year when another 30,000 Americans lost their lives to firearms (11,000 in homicides), or in a country where 1,800 women like Kasandra Perkins are killed in gun disputes and another 5,000 are treated for assault-related gunshot wounds every year. It wasnt during presidential debates. It wasnt after Trayvon Martin was killed for wearing a hoodie, after Jared Lee Loughner shot a member of Congress in the head, after the Dark Knight Rises theater shooting, or after the latest murderous weekend in one of our nations biggest cities. So if those werent the right times, and this isnt either, when? Which high-profile murder, suicide, or mass killing will be the one that gets us to talk? 
Perhaps, if Jovan Belcher didnt own a gun, he would have found another way to kill Kasandra Perkins and himself. Or perhaps he wouldnt have. Having a gun in the home, after all, increases both the risk of homicide and suicide, and 60 percent of our nations homicides are committed with guns. Studies have shown that guns in the home increase chances of homicide two to three times, and gun death rates are seven times higher in states that have high household gun ownership (Missouri is 21st, and considered a high-ownership state), according to the Brady Campaign. For suicide, guns present a similar problem. Every study that has examined the issue to date has found that within the U.S., access to firearms is associated with increased suicide risk, according to Harvards School of Public Health, and suicides committed with guns are most likely to be successful.
A domestic dispute in any home may leave a woman bloody and bruised, but in a home without a gun, its far less likely to leave her murdered. The presence of a firearm in the home increases the risk of homicide for women by five times, according to one study, and two-thirds of women killed with guns each year die in domestic disputes. When a domestic dispute involves a firearm, it is 12 times more likely to end in homicide. If Jovan Belcher didnt have a gun, perhaps his mother, who watched her son shoot the mother of his three-month-old daughter, could have helped calmed the fight. If Jovan Belcher didnt have a gun, perhaps the coaches and executives who watched him put the final bullet through his own head, or the police officers who arrived seconds too late, could have saved his life.
Well never know if the lack of a legally-owned gun would have changed the situation and kept both Kasandra Perkins and Jovan Belcher alive. Whitlock believes it would have, and I do too. What we do know is that Saturday morning, a gun made it easier for a man to kill his girlfriend, to take his own life, to leave his three-month-old daughter without her parents. And the Jovan Belcher story happens somewhere in this country every day. Somewhere, today, a man will shoot his girlfriend. A woman will shoot herself. A teenage boy will die at the hand of a firearm. A dispute that could have ended with a punch will instead end with a bullet. If that isnt enough to make us talk about the role of guns in our society, I dont know what is.

Thirteen year old Mckenna Popes little brother loves to cook. But when he watches the commercials for a product hes hoping to get for Christmas — the Easy Bake Oven — he only sees girls playing with the toy. Because of that, he believes that only girls play with it.
Pope is hoping to change that perception with a video and a petition. She is asking Hasboro — maker of the Easy Bake Oven — to start putting boys in their commercials, so that her little brother sees its okay for boys to cook:
[B]oys are not featured in  packaging or promotional materials for Easy Bake Ovens — this toy my brothers always dreamed about. And the oven comes in gender-specific hues: purple and pink.
I feel that this sends a clear message: women cook, men work. [...]
I want my brother to know that its not wrong for him to want to be a chef, that its okay to go against what society believes to be appropriate. There are, as a matter of fact, a multitude of very talented and successful male culinary geniuses, i.e. Emeril, Gordon Ramsey, etc. Unfortunately, Hasbro has made going against the societal norm that girls are the ones in the kitchen even more difficult.
Watch her appeal:

For a 13-year-old, Popes assessment is incredibly on-message with what experts understand about the link between confidence and gender stereotypes. Societal reinforcement of traditional gender roles can lead children to doubt their own ability, as evidenced by girls lack of confidence in mathematics based on their parents enforcement of gender stereotypes.
Popes petition has gathered over 18,000 signatures so far.

Rep. John Duncan Jr. (R-TN)A Republican congressman took to the radio last week, urging citizens to return to a gold standard or pensions will become almost worthless.
Rep. John Duncan, Jr. (R-TN) appeared on the Mike Church Show last Monday to discuss a range of economic topics, including monetary policy. Midway through the interview, Church blamed our fiscal malaise on the Federal Reserve and asked Duncan, Wouldnt it be prudent for Republicans to gently begin urging their citizens to return to gold? I agree with you completely, the Tennessee congressman replied:
CHURCH: For the first time since 1996, the term gold standard was actually mentioned in the RNC platform. Gov. Romney made hardly any mention of it whatsoever. Isnt the fiscal cliff and our fiscal malaise at least partly to blame on the federal reserve and our reckless monetary policy? Wouldnt it be prudent for Republicans to gently begin urging their citizens to return to gold?
DUNCAN: Yes, I agree with you completely. [...] The best way to protect our money and keep us from facing things like I mentioned a few minutes ago like our pensions and so forth becoming almost worthless is to return to a gold standard or non-inflationary policies.
Listen:

Beyond the irresponsibility of such a statement, Duncans desire to tie our economy to a rock is nonsensical. Those advocating for a return to the gold standard justify it with fear of runaway inflation, but inflation rates are currently at historic lows.
The main problem with the gold standard, though, is that its never worked. It would wreak havoc on the both the U.S. and worldwide economy. There isnt enough gold in existence. And basing currency on a rock is no less arbitrary than an agreed-upon piece of paper. The idea is so far out there, in fact, that even conservative economic hero Milton Friedman opposed it.

Throughout the election, Republicans tried to sell Rep. Paul Ryans (R-WI) Medicare reforms by arguing that the partys proposed changes would not affect current seniors. Our point is we need to preserve their benefits, because government made promises to them that theyve organized their retirements around, Ryan argued in his first interview after being named as Mitt Romneys running mate. In order to make sure we can do that, you must reform it for those of us who are younger. 
But in negotiating legislation to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, Republicans are abandoning this guarantee and pressuring President Obama to accept immediate changes to the program as a down payment for larger structural reform: 

Republicans have countered by arguing for a smaller down payment that must include immediate savings from Medicare and other entitlements….House Republicans say the down payment should be at least $110 billion, the value of the automatic spending cuts they would cancel next year, and they want those savings to come largely from cuts in Medicare and other benefit programs. [...] 
But Republicans say they are selling Congress short on what can be done before the January deadline. They made clear that they want some initial changes to entitlement programs ahead of larger talks next year.
Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho and another Gang of Six member, said some initial changes to entitlement programs could and should be in the down payment.
The party has largely dismissed President Obamas proposal of identifying savings and inefficiencies from providers and drug manufacturers in search of so-called serious savings that will surely impact beneficiaries. As Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) bragged on Sunday during an appearance on Meet The Press, I laid out in great detail very painful cuts to Medicare….  We really have to look at much deeper reforms to the entitlements. 
Update   The GOP has presented a $2.2 trillion counter offer that includes $800 billion in tax reform, $600 billion in health care cuts and $600 billion in other cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending.

Before Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (R) delivered a speech on energy this weekend, a reporter for the local station 3TV News managed to unnerve Brewer with the last issue she had in mind: Global warming. Unhappy with the question, Brewer confronted him afterward, asking, Where in the hell did that come from?
Brewer, who denies manmade global warming, told 3TV News:

Everybody has an opinion on it, you know, and I probably dont believe that its man made. I believe that, you know, that weather and certain elements are controlled maybe by different things.

Watch it (at the 1 minute mark):



Brewers energy speech only drew two colleagues, and if she had the climate science correct her remarks would have had more relevance. Arizona has reason enough to care about climate change. According to a Center for American Progress report, the state was hit by three separate billion-dollar weather events since 2011 — raging wildfires, drought, and a heat wave — hitting on average counties with households 3 percent below U.S. median income.
Update   TPM reports that Brewer allegedly hit the reporter with her closed fist after he asked her the question: 

After her answer, a handler swooped in and whisked her away, but about three paces out she turned back around to face the reporter who asked the last question. He had turned to a camera operator and seemed to be putting his microphone away. Brewer took her left hand, balled it into a fist and with the back of her hand she slugged the reporter on the back of his right arm. Not hard, but with enough force that he spun around to see what was going on.

Rick Santorum has joined WorldNetDaily, a conspiracy theory blog best known for its indefatigable work advancing the birther movement, as an exclusive columnist.
The former Pennsylvania senator, who was voted out of office in 2006, will use the perch to remain in the conservative consciousness as he eyes another presidential bid in 2016. His column will be featured on the site every Monday.
Santorums extreme views will fit in well at WorldNetDaily. In the past, he has compared homosexuality to bestiality, told rape victims they shouldnt be permitted to get an abortion but rather should make the best out of a bad situation, and said food stamps are unnecessary because obesity rates are so high.

Virginias Republican Party appears poised to nominate state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli to be its candidate for governor in 2013 — embracing a man whose extreme political views bear striking resemblance to those of unsuccessful 2012 Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO).
With his fervent anti-science, anti-choice, and anti-LGBT, anti-federal government activism, Akins extreme positions were well known long before his infamous August pronouncement that victims of legitimate rape are unlikely to become pregnant helped derail his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign. Cuccinellis views closely mirror Akins in all of those areas.
Over seven-and-a-half years as a Virginia state senator and three years as the commonwealths attorney general, Republican Ken Cuccinelli II has been, in the words of the Washington Posts editorial board, the most overtly partisan attorney general in Virginias history. Though he claims he is best known for his efforts to preserve liberty and defend the US Constitution, it is his opposition to liberty for women and LGBT Americans and his frequent court losses based on his flawed constitutional theories that have defined his political career to date.
While perhaps not as careless as Akin with his rhetoric, Cuccinelli has embraced many of the same extreme positions:
1. He wants an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. His 2002 campaign website laid out Cuccinellis abortion views clearly: Ken believes that human life begins at conception, and that human beings should be respected and protected from conception to natural death, it said. Ken would seek to require sonograms to be part of a 24-hour waiting period with an informed consent requirement. Ken opposes abortions that are not for the purpose of saving the mothers life. Over his political career, he has pushed to defund Planned Parenthood and embryonic stem cell research. He pushed for a ban on third trimester abortions — making no exception for serious health risks on the woman — and for safety regulations for abortion providers designed to force clinics to close. He has also highlighted his opposition to RU-486 and his support for a conscience law protecting the right of professionals to refuse to perform an action that is inconsistent with their moral convictions — such as providing emergency contraception — without losing their job. Cuccinelli frequently attacks Planned Parenthood and has suggested that the fact that abortion clinics in Virginia are in urban areas with large African American populations is an example of white racism. His ultimate goal, he has said, is to make abortion disappear in America.
2. He does not believe LGBT people deserve legal protections. Cuccinelli has made it clear that he believes same-sex relationships are immoral.  In 2009, he told a Virginia newspaper, My view is that homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong. Theyre intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural law based country its appropriate to have policies that reflect that. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in its 2003 Lawrence v. Texas case that such bans were unconstitutional, he still voted against repealing a state law making consensual sodomy a felony. He has actively pushed for state and federal constitutional amendments to prevent any legal recogntition of what he terms what theyd like to refer to as ‘homosexual families, authoring a resolution calling for a federal amendment to invalidate any same-sex marriage, civil union, domestic partnership, or other relationship analogous to marriage. He has opined that giving public sanction to homosexual marriage ends up redefining marriage and its certain to harm children. He even opposed a state bill that allowed private companies to voluntarily provide health insurance benefits to employees domestic partners, warning it might encourage this type of behavior. His advisory opinion that Virginias public colleges and universities should rescind their non-discrimination policies was called reprehensible by a former Republican state legislator.

A constant conservative charge against President Obama is that he is inherently anti-business. However, businesses keep defying the storyline by making larger and larger profits, rebounding nicely out of the Great Recession.
In the third quarter of this year, corporate earnings were $1.75 trillion, up 18.6% from a year ago. Corporations are currently making more as a percentage of the economy than they ever have since such records were kept. But at the same time, wages as a percentage of the economy are at an all-time low, as this chart shows. (The red line is corporate profits; the blue line is private sector wages.):

Corporations made a record $824 billion in profits last year as well, while the stock market has had one of its best performances since 1900 while Obama has been in office. 
Meanwhile, workers are getting the short end of the stick. As CNN Money explained, a separate government reading shows that total wages have now fallen to a record low of 43.5% of GDP. Until 1975, wages almost always accounted for at least half of GDP, and had been as high as 49% as recently as early 2001.

 Every holiday season, Fox News launches an attack on the War on Christmas, documenting perceived offenses like the term holiday tree or nativity scenes removed from local state buildings. For back-up, Fox and Friends invited Father Jonathan Morris, a Catholic priest and regular contributor, to discuss the so-called war.
Morris has previously called Islam a messed up religion and said that clergy should be ready to die in the fight against President Obamas birth control coverage mandate. But on Sundays segment, Morris drew the line at the war on Christmas, calling it silly and pointing out that the number of people actually attempting to restrict expressions of faith is a very small percentage.
The reason Im not angry is that, yes, I think its silly, its out of place for people to dedicate so much energy to try to get rid of Christmas scenes like this. The good news is when Christianity has been persecuted, when it has been outlawed, when people have died for their faith, it hasnt gone away. Everybody has an opportunity to make sure their faith does not go away in this Christmas season to live that faith as a family, as a community. What should we do about these, I think very small percentage of people who are working to try to get rid of these public expressions of faith? I think we should speak up. Thats why I am doing it. Thats why I think its important we have these stories to show what they are trying to do — without losing the peace. If our Christmas is going to be all about getting a upset at people trying to take away Christmas, isnt that silly too?

Watch it:

Morris did defend public expressions of faith, explaining that the courts allow state buildings to host religious displays. Finally, he laughed, You guys look so angry about this war on Christmas!

Carbon pollution shows no sign of slowing;  2011 emissions jumped 3 percent, and 2012 is on track for another 2.6 percent. According to a new report by the Global Carbon Project, the worlds fossil fuel addiction pumped 38.2 billion tons of carbon pollution, or 2.4 million every second, last year. 
The worlds top polluter, China, and India had the largest increases of 10 percent (to 10 billion tons) and 7 percent (to 2.5 billion tons) respectively. The only two of the worlds top polluters with lower emissions were the U.S., the second-largest polluter, and Germany. When the world needs immediate action to cut emissions, this trend of routinely toppling records has scientists uncertain whether the international goal — to limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit – is even attainable.

During an appearance on Meet The Press Sunday morning, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) repeatedly dodged host David Gregorys questions on whether or not he would be willing to accept increases on the wealthiest Americans tax rates in a deal to prevent the nation from going over the so-called fiscal cliff.
Instead, Corker referred to his own recently-proposed plan to raise revenue through closing tax loopholes. When pressed by Gregory on whether this would be the only revenue source that he would consider in a deal, he replied that revenues through capping deductions and eliminating loopholes would be a more pro-growth approach, but conspicuously did not rule out a rate hike on wealthier Americans marginal tax rates:
CORKER: Look, Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell both have put revenues on the table. 
DAVID GREGORY (HOST): Lets just understand. Everybody in Washington says revenues. Theres increasing your tax rates and theres finding other ways to raise tax revenue. And the distinction is important, because what republicans object to is raising your tax rates — Your actual marginal tax rates. Thats the distinction that you have to answer, right?
CORKER: Well, you can get there two ways. One of the ways is the way I proposed, which is closing loopholes. Thats a pro-growth way of getting more revenues from wealthy Americans. And I think, David, before this is all over with, theres lots of machinations. Theres capital gains, dividends. And I think cooler heads will prevail. And I think we will resolve this. And thats the very best thing we can do to get our economy going.
Republicans have been generally vague in outlining an acceptable compromise on Americans tax rates. 
But an increasing number of GOP lawmakers have been backing away from absolutist dogma on increasing the wealthiest Americans tax rates in a deal with President Obama. Recently, prominent GOP senators such as Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) have signaled that they are open to increasing taxes in order to avert the fiscal cliff. 
Last week, Corker also backed away from anti-tax purist Grover Norquists pledge to not raise taxes under any circumstances, asserting, I am not obligated on the pledge.

 After voters rejected Republican economic proposals, the GOP sought the appearance of compromise with the president on averting the so-called fiscal cliff. The gesture was strictly rhetorical, since their stance just restates the Romney/Ryan tax plan to disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans, coupled with steep cuts to entitlement programs for the middle class.
On Fox News Sunday, House Speaker John Boehner summarized the three major myths Republicans have used in fiscal showdown negotiations: 

MYTH: Feigning shock at economic proposals that voters endorsed:  Boehner said the White Houses initial outline to avert the so-called fiscal cliff was a complete surprise: I was flabbergasted. I said you cant be serious. I have never seen anything like it. However, much of President Obamas current proposal appeared in his 20-page plan, released in October, which has explicit mentions of tax cuts for the middle class, small business tax breaks, and entitlement savings. At the time, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT)dismissed it as a glossy brochure, and nothing but a rehash of the same failed ideas of the past four years. Boehner and Hatch are pretending to encounter Obamas economic plan for the first time, when it has been on the table well before he won reelection.
MYTH: We have laid it all out for them, a dozen ways to raise the revenue from the richest Americans. Boehner claimed that Republicans have detailed their revenue counterplan to Obamas proposal to allow Bush tax cuts to expire for the wealthiest 2 percent, while extending them for the middle class. On Sunday, pressed to provide details on their biggest proposal since the election, Boehner dodged answering. Rather than increase marginal tax rates on the richest Americans, Republicans back eliminating tax loopholes and entitlement cuts mirrored in Paul Ryans budget. The pitch is much like Mitt Romneys, which attracted criticism for his lack of specificity on which loopholes could make up for lower tax rates for the wealthiest Americans.
MYTH: Obama has put $400 billion worth of unspecified cuts on the table. Boehner claimed Obamas unserious proposal lacks details on what entitlement savings he would put forward. But the details for Obamas proposal for $400 billion in savings in Medicare and other social programs have existed for quite some time, in his FY 2013 budget released in February. It includes $600 billion in reforms and savings, to our health care and other government programs, without the dramatic restructuring that Republicans propose, as well as $1.6 trillion in revenue.

Rep. Allen West (R-FL), the controversial and outspoken, one-term Tea Partier, lost his re-election bid to his Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy earlier this month. During his two years in the House of Representatives, West earned a reputation as one of the most brash Republicans as well as a top Islamophobe in Congress.

MARTIN: So whats next for you?
WEST: Look, you know, God closes a door so that he can open up greater doors. I will continue to, you know, stand up and fight for this country. Thats my goal. I have two daughters, 19 and 16, and I want to make sure that they grow up in a great America that provides them all the opportunities that it provided to their mother and father.
MARTIN: Congressman Allen West is completing his term in Congress. He was kind enough to join us from a House recording studio on Capitol Hill here in Washington, D.C.
WEST: And always remember, Abraham Lincoln only served one term in Congress, too.
It took West two weeks after the November 6 election to concede to Murphy. He told supporters last week that he hasnt decided if he will run for office again. Its not like my life ends, and my life of service to this country doesnt, he said, according to local media reports.

On Sunday, during an appearance on Meet the Press, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) reiterated his call for restructuring entitlement programs like Medicare, highlighting the very painful cuts he has proposed as part of a package to avert the fiscal cliff. Corker 242-page plan calls for a Paul Ryan-like proposal to transform the guaranteed Medicare benefit into a voucher plan for beneficiaries. 
Host David Gregory seemed to agree with Corkers characterization and pressed fellow panelist Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) to accept reforms that will shift health care costs to seniors in order to show that Democrats are serious about entitlements: 

CORKER: Look, I laid out in great detail very painful cuts to Medicare. I just did it in a 242 page bill that Ive shared with the White House [...]
GREGORY: Name some specific programs that ought to be cut that would cause pain in terms of the role of our government that Democrats are prepared to support.
McCASKILL: Well, I think you can see more cuts frankly and a lot of us voted for more cuts in the farm program…and defense. I spent a lot of times in the wings of the Pentagon. if you dont think theres more money to be cut in contracting at the pentagon, you dont understand what has happened at the Pentagon. [...]
CORKER: David, as much as I love Claire, those are not the painful cuts that have to happen. We really have to look at much deeper reforms to the entitlements … I think the Speaker is frustrated right now because as youve mentioned, the White House keeps spiking the ball on tax increases for the wealthy. But has not yet been forthcoming on real entitlement reform. And without the two, there really is no deal.  
Indeed, Republicans have dismissed President Obamas opening offer of $600 billion in reforms and savings to health care and other government programs, insisting that they are not painful or serious enough to lower spending. The Democrats proposal identifies specific inefficiencies and waste from providers and drug manufacturers and asks wealthier seniors to pay more for health care. But Republicans — and some in the media — are only interested in serious plans that directly reduce benefits or substantially increase out of pocket spending for seniors and poor Americans who rely on Medicaid. The cuts are designed to shrink entitlement programs and consequently cause very real pain to the people who benefit from them.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that Republicans will be to blame if Congress cant pass a balanced plan to avert the so-called fiscal cliff and insisted that President Obama would not sign a proposal that extends President Bushs tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of Americans. 
Asked, during an appearance on Fox News Sunday, if the country would avert the mix of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that are scheduled to go into effect next year, Geithner insisted that it could, but only if Republicans allowed lower taxes on the wealthiest to expire: 

CHRIS WALLACE (HOST): Last question, can you promise that we will not go over the cliff?
GEITHNER: No, I cant promise that. That is a decision that lies in the hands of the Republicans, that are now opposing increases in tax rates, if they recognize the reality, that we cannot afford to extend the tax rates we have the basis for an agreement that would be good for the American people. 
WALLACE: And the President bears no responsibility, it is all up to the Republicans?
GEITHNER: Chris, ask yourself this question, why does it make sense for the country to force tax increases on all Americans, because a small group of Republicans want to extend tax rates for 2% of Americans — why does that make any sense? There is no reason why it should happen, we cant afford the tax rates, that is like the deep tragic lesson of the last decade, we and not afford them and will not get through it, to the end now, without a recognition of the Republicans to that basic reality and that will be the responsible thing to do and my judgment is, they are going to do it because there is no alternative to that.

The Treasury Secretary also laid out the administrations proposal for averting the cliff, stressing that the mix of increased revenue and entitlement cuts are grounded in proposals the administration included in the Presidents FY 2013 budget and offered during the 2011 budget negotiations. 
Alongside the $1.6 trillion in tax increases and $80 billion in investments that Obama is offering, he is also agreeing to $600 billion in reforms and savings, to our health care and other government programs. The reductions, Geithner said, are on top of the trillion dollars in spending cuts we agreed with republicans, last year, on defense and a range of other government programs. 
Republicans have demagogued the proposal. They oppose raising marginal tax rates, but are open to increasing revenue by closing loopholes and deductions, so long as those reforms are tied to unspecified structural changes to Medicare and Medicaid.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), who has refused to support raising marginal tax rates on the richest Americans in order to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, told Fox News Sunday that it doesnt matter if the government raises revenue by reducing programs or eliminating tax deductions that also benefit lower and middle class Americans or asks the wealthiest to pay more:  

CHIRS WALLACE (HOST): You talked about the fact that the President won and you came out with a concession the day after the election and they point out that the president campaigned on raising tax rates, you know, and it was the big issue, between him and Romney, and, they say, just as he had to cave, after your victory, in the 2010 midterms, now, it is your turn to cave on tax rates. 
BOEHNER: Listen, what is this difference where the money comes from? We put $800 billion worth of revenue, which is what he is asking for, out of eliminating the top two tax rates. But, heres the problem, Chris, when you go and increase tax rates, you make it more difficult for our economy to grow, after that income, the small business income, it is going to get taxed at a higher rate and as a result were gonna see slower economic growth, we cant cut our way out of this problem, nor can we grow our way out of the problem, we have to have a balanced approach and what the President wants to do will slow or economy at a time when he says he wants the economy to grow and create jobs. 
Despite Boehners rhetoric, there is no economic evidence to suggest that taxing income above $250,000 hurts the economy. In fact, business thrived during President Clintons tenure, as the wealthy paid more. 
There is a clear difference to where the money comes from, however, and asking higher-income Americans who have benefited the most to pay more is fairer than gutting critical entitlement programs during a slow economic recovery. While middle-class incomes have stagnated, Americas top income bracket has enjoyed a period of exceptionally low tax rates thanks largely to caps on investment income and tax cuts put in place by former president George W. Bush. These super-rich Americans have fared well under President Obama, too; corporate profits are skyrocketing and the total number of millionaires in the US has exploded during his term.

Today marks World AIDS Day, an annual public health initiative to raise awareness about and mobilize support for combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic around the globe. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pointed out in a speech earlier this week, significant advances in HIV research and treatment suggest that an AIDS-free generation may be in sight.
Clintons optimism is shared by the United Nations, whose officials recently noted they believe eradicating AIDS is entirely feasible thanks to the global communitys dedicated efforts against the epidemic. Here are five important advancements weve made toward that goal over the past year:
1. Increased access to HIV testing. Thanks to medical experts recommendation that Americans between the ages of 15 and 65 get regularly screened for the virus, annual HIV testing will now be covered under Obamacare. And in addition to removing some of the cost barriers to getting tested, this past year also included advances in the ease and availability of HIV testing. The FDA approved the first over-the-counter test that can be taken at home, and the CDC rolled out a pilot program to allow Americans in low-income areas to get tested for HIV at their local pharmacy. Since the CDC estimates that as many as 20 percent of the 1.1 million Americans who have HIV arent aware theyre infected with the virus, taking steps to ensure that testing is affordable and accessible is more important than ever.
2. Improved coverage under Obamacare.  Before Obamacare, HIV-positive Americans often struggled to enroll in private insurance plans — but since insurers will no longer be able to discriminate against people with HIV based on their pre-existing condition, Obamacare will ensure that more HIV-positive individuals can access health care. Furthermore, the health law eliminates lifetime caps on coverage, so people with the virus wont reach limits on the amount of HIV treatment their insurance companies are willing to cover for them. Obamacare also stipulates that HIV-positive Americans dont have to have AIDS before accessing Medicaid coverage — an old requirement for participating in the program — so those with HIV wont have to wait until theyre sicker before getting the health insurance they need.
3. Better, simpler treatments for the virus. In July, the World Health Organization noted that future HIV infections could be totally eliminated with the help of the current arsenal of drugs developed to combat the virus. And that same month, the FDA  officially approved  Stribild, an oral pill that combines four medications in one to treat HIV-positive individuals. Continued advancements in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications — which public health researchers credit with significantly reducing HIV/AIDS-related deaths since 1996, when HAART treatments were first introduced — are helping to ease the treatment process, also gains in this area continue to be stratified along racial and economic lines.
4. Breakthroughs in HIV research. Obamacare allocates more funding for HIV research and prevention, including $30 million from a new preventative health fund that is specifically designated for HIV education programs, public health initiatives, and scientific investments. And scientists continue to make important progress in developing new treatments and vaccines for the HIV virus, including a potential vaccine that could eventually prevent HIV infection by producing disease-fighting cells. Scientists also continue to advance toward eradicating latent HIV, which has posed a challenge because the virus is not impacted by other types of treatment when it is dormant in the body.
5. Raised life expectancy for HIV-positive individuals.  The CDC estimates just in just a few years, half of HIV-positive Americans will be over the age of 50. Described as the graying of the HIV-positive community, the shifting demographics point to the fact that people with HIV are now living longer and healthier lives. Thanks to effective treatment methods for the virus, as well as recent scientific innovation that allows more HIV-positive individuals to receive organ transplants, a positive diagnosis for the virus is no longer a death sentence. In fact, according to a recent study, the life expectancy for HIV-positive people in Britain is fast approaching the national average.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) ripped into President Obamas opening offer on a package to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, during the GOPs weekly address on Saturday, characterizing the proposal as radical and a classic bait-and-switch. Maybe I missed it but I dont recall him asking for any of that during the presidential campaign, Hatch said. These ideas are so radical that they have already been rejected on a bipartisan basis by Congress. 
Watch it:

Obamas proposal — which includes $1.6 trillion in increased taxes on the rich over the next decade, $400 billion in savings in Medicare and other social programs, $50 billion in stimulus spending to begin next year, and an end to current debt ceiling rules — is not new or radical: it reflects the very same same policies Obama advanced for years and promoted extensively on the campaign trail. 
For instance, Obamas FY 2013 budget — released in February 2012 —  raised an additional $1.7 trillion in revenue and proposed $360 billion in savings from entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. (Comparatively, Simpson-Bowles called for $2.7 trillion revenue over 10 years, more than what Obama requested). Obama advocated for additional stimulative spending throughout the campaign, calling for a path forward that will continue investing in education and infrastructure.
Republicans are feigning shock that Obama is proposing to implement the very same policies that Americans voted for in November, as they seek to define his second term agenda and bolster their own negotiating position. Meanwhile, they have yet to offer their own detailed proposal to avert the cliff. 
Update  Much of President Obamas current proposal appeared in his 20-page plan, released in October. Hatch apparently missed these explicit mentions of tax cuts for the middle class (but not the wealthiest Americans), small business tax breaks to stimulate the economy, and entitlement savings — then and now. In a Politco op/ed following the plans original release, Hatch mocked it as a glossy 20-page brochure but not a plan, and dismissed it as nothing but a rehash of the same failed ideas of the past four years.

Because a short-term criminal sentence is not necessarily a sentence to suffer with a terminal illness in prison, both the federal government and the states have a process by which those prisoners who have been diagnosed with a fatal illness – or who have some other change of situation such as a dying family member — can apply for release. But the chance of federal prisoners being granted release is exceedingly low, according to a new study by Human Rights Watch and Families Against Mandatory Minimums. While even tough states like Texas let out about 100 people per year on medical parole, the federal system releases on average around two dozen people, out of a population of more than 218,000 inmates. One such inmate highlighted by the report died while in prison for gun possession, despite a plea for release from the judge who sentenced him:
Michael Mahoney was sentenced in 1994 to a mandatory minimum term of 15 years as an armed career criminal. The career criminal designation derived from three drug sales totaling less than $300 to an undercover agent over a three-week period in the late 1970. Felons, like Mahoney, may not legally possess firearms. Erroneously believing that enough time had lapsed since his prior convictions to allow him to carry a gun, Mahoney had purchased one to protect himself when making night deposits from his small business. When the gun was stolen, he duly reported it to authorities, his error was discovered, and he was prosecuted. Years later, in 2004, Mahoney was dying in prison from lymphoma and asked for compassionate release. The warden at the Lexington Federal Medical Center thought the BOP should file a motion on his behalf, and the regional director agreed.
In late July, BOP Director Harley Lappin denied Mahoneys request, even though the regional director had approved the request and it was unopposed by the US attorney. Lappins decision was based on the totality of the circumstances and Mahoneys multiple felony convictions.
On July 26, 2004, Judge James D. Todd, who had sentenced Mahoney, hearing of the directors denial, wrote to Lappin, stating that in 20 years on the bench he had never before written to a corrections official on behalf of a prisoner he had sentenced. Describing the circumstances of Mahoneys conviction, he said that Mr. Mahoneys case has troubled me since I sentenced him in 1994 … [as] one of those cases in which a well-intentioned and sound law resulted in an injustice. He said he was aware that Mahoney was bedridden, suffering great pain, and considered near death. He suggested that … a motion [for compassionate release] is the only way to mitigate in a very small way the harshness which [the Armed Career Criminal Act] has caused in this unusual and unfortunate case. Lappin did not reply. Mahoney died a few days later.
Whats more, the report documents the extraordinary financial and societal savings that would result from more compassionate releases:
Increasing the number of dying or debilitated prisoners who are granted compassionate release … but would free the BOP from the unnecessary security costs of confining prisoners who pose scant risk of harm to anyone and from their medical costs. The per capita cost of caring for a prisoner in one of the BOPs medical centers was $40,760 in FY 2010, compared to an overall per capita cost of $25,627. Releasing prisoners who are not suffering from grave medical conditions but who face other compelling circumstances—such as those whose children are destined for the foster care system or who are desperately needed at home to care for dying family members—would advance other important societal goals, such as preservation of the family.
Human Rights Watch senior adviser Jamie Fellner told NPR that she believes its the federal prison culture that fosters the alarmingly low rate of release. Theyre in the business of keeping people in prison, Fellner said.
A similar phenomenon is occurring in the federal process for granting pardons (which revoke convictions) and commutations (which shorten sentences), handled by another arm of the DOJ, the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Some people, including former White House Counsel Greg Craig, have suggested the abysmally low rate of both forms of relief is reason to remove this function from the Department of Justice, and similar measures might prove effective in the compassionate release context. The Human Rights Watch report instead suggests reform within both the DOJ and the BOP, which it says is misconstruing its role as a vehicle for recommending motions to the courts.

With Republicans balking at the prospect of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the top 2 percent of Americans, Democrats are losing patience. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) said Friday that the House GOP will not hold a vote on a middle-class tax bill that excludes the top income brackets, even though the Senate has already approved one.
In response, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced Friday that Democrats plan to bring the legislation to a floor vote next week no matter what. The Democrats plan to use a discharge petition, which can force a bill to the floor if it has been stuck in committee for 30 legislative days. In a new statement, Pelosi dared her Republican colleagues to reject the plan to extend tax cuts for 98 percent of the country:
The clock is ticking, the year is ending, its really important, with tax legislation, for it to happen now.  Were calling upon the Republican leadership in the House to bring this legislation to the floor next week.  We believe that not doing that would be holding middle-income tax cuts hostage to tax cuts for the rich.  Tax cuts for the rich which do not create jobs, just increase the deficit, heaping mountains of debt onto future generations.  
And so, to that end, we are – we will be introducing, if the bill, if there is no announcement of scheduling of the middle income tax cut, which, by the way, has tremendous support in the Republican Caucus – I think we would get a 100 percent vote on it if it came to the floor. If it is not scheduled, then on Tuesday we will be introducing a discharge petition which you know with – if we get 218 signatures, would bring the bill automatically to the floor. That would mean that we need some Republicans who support middle income tax cuts, to sign on with us.

Watch it:

In order to make a discharge petition work, Pelosi needs 20 Republicans to sign on to the measure. Several Republican legislators, notably Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), have called for Republicans to accept President Obamas deal on middle-class tax cuts.

A bridge in Paulsboro, New Jersey collapsed Friday morning, derailing a train carrying highly flammable and carcinogenic vinyl chloride into Mantua Creek. The most recent reports say at least 28 people are having trouble breathing from the spills vapors and residents are being evacuated. Local schools are in lockdown.
This is the second time in four years that this bridge has collapsed. In 2009, the bridge buckled and plunged several coal cars into the creek. The bridge has certainly weathered a lot of wear and tear since it was built in 1873. Residents were not surprised last time it collapsed:
Gary Stevenson, a former Paulsboro fire chief whose two-year-old house is a matter of yards from the buckled bridge, said he has become accustomed to a boom, boom, boom noise as trains cross the span. The exact section where they are at, Stevenson said, pointing to Conrail workers surveying the damage. Boom, boom. The exact section. Conrail crews, are there twice a week as of late, Stevenson said. The bridge with an iron A frame dates to 1873 two years older than his grandmothers house on whose ground Stevenson built his residence. … [Mayor John] Burzichelli observed things could have been a lot worse. No rail cars overturned. Burzichelli noted the affected cars were carrying coal not hazardous liquids.

Even if the Mantua Creek bridge is successfully repaired after this latest disaster, there are thousands of similar time bomb bridges around the country ready to collapse at any moment. The average American bridge is now 43 years old — and a 2008 Department of Transportation survey determined that 72,868 are structurally deficient, while 89,024 are functionally obsolete. 
Despite the urgency of this crisis, US spending on infrastructure is projected to fall short by $139 billion or more over the next decade. Meanwhile, Republicans have pushed for a devastating cut of $871 billion in infrastructure investment.
Paulsboro Mayor Burzichelli apparently reached out to Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) for expedited repairs to the Mantua Creek bridge in 2009. Lautenberg introduced a bill in 2011 to encourage private investment in infrastructure and bolster federal funding. The bill, unfortunately, went nowhere.
As Paulsboro struggles to clean up this most recent mess, its worth remembering that infrastructure investment is not only desperately needed, but would also provide a huge boost to the economy. A new study found that every dollar invested in infrastructure has a return for state economies of at least $2. The effects are even more pronounced during an economic downturn.

Film star Christian Slater live-tweeted his nightmarish voting process in Florida on Election Day. Even as a celebrity, Slater had to endure the same hours-long lines as other Florida voters. Once he finally made it to the front of the line, Slater was told his DMV registration was out of date and he had to cast a provisional ballot. Today he received a letter informing him that, after all that trouble, his vote was discarded.
BuzzFeed posted the letter, addressed to Christina Slater, and Slaters tweets though he later deleted them:


The election chaos in Florida can largely be blamed on several reforms undertaken by Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL) to restrict early voting hours and tighten restrictions on eligible voters. A post-election study found that these election law changes led to a huge increase in provisional ballots. Clearly, countless other Floridians besides Slater had their votes wrongly discarded. State GOP members have openly admitted that these laws were geared toward suppressing the minority and Democratic vote, even though they were billed publicly as ways to combat voter fraud. Florida Democrats called for a federal probe of Floridas election laws earlier this week.

The New Jersey State Senate voted yesterday to increase the Garden States minimum wage to $8.50 per hour, a $1.50 raise that would be effective March 1st. Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) has threatened to veto the bill, due to a provision that would automatically increase the minimum wage according to inflation.
Several New Jersey Republicans tried to use the recent Hurricane Sandy — which decimated Jerseys shoreline — as justification for opposing the increase:
The aftermath of Sandy, which changed so much about the state, was ever-present in Thursdays two-hour debate on the Senate floor, giving another wrinkle to a debate thats largely a moral and philosophical battle. It was still that on the Senate floor Thursday, with Republicans saying a minimum wage increase would hurt businesses and could force layoffs, and Democrats asserting that its wrong for New Jerseyans to be paid so little in a place where its expensive to live.
Republican Sen. Jennifer Beck, R-Red Bank, said she supports raising minimum wage but said the storm made this the wrong time to do it. She told of small shore business owners still sweeping up glass and wondering if their businesses would survive the winter. Our Legislatures first response following a hurricane that devastated thousands is not a helping hand but a greater burden, she said.
Christie also used that line of reasoning:
The Republican governor said Wednesday that he was willing to consider a responsible minimum-wage package. But with many businesses struggling to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy, Christie said, he has concerns about the bill, which would increase the hourly rate to $8.50 from $7.25 by March 1.
Weve got thousands of businesses wiped out, he said at a news conference Wednesday in Trenton. Is this really now the moment to say to those folks, ‘Were going to hit you with a $1.25 increase on March 1 and [cost-of-living increases] beyond that?
Study after study has shown that minimum wage hikes do not, in fact, hurt business and force layoffs (even during rough economic times). And New Jersey was a premier test case: University of California, Berkeley, economist David Card and Princeton economist Alan Kruegers seminal study of the effect of the New Jersey 1992 minimum wage increase comparing fast food industry employment in New Jersey and Pennsylvania found no negative employment effect. In fact, it found stronger employment growth in New Jersey.
Lets not hide behind the storm, said state Sen. Stephen Sweeney (D). This bill was opposed by many prior to that. Sen. Richard Codey (D) added, Can you live on $8.50 an hour? How about these people during the storm, you think they could go to the few diners that were open? They cant do that.

In their first effort to tackle immigration reform since President Obamas re-election, House Republicans on Friday advanced a bill that would add visas for highly skilled workers while reducing legal immigration overall. The measure, which passed by a vote of 245-139, had failed just two months ago, before Republicans lost Hispanic support in record numbers.  
The STEM Act expands the number of visas available to international students who earn masters and doctorates in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) fields at U.S. universities, while also cutting the Diversity Visa program and reducing the number of total visas available. Under the measure, unused STEM visas are not re-allocated to other immigrants and simply disappear.
While 27 Democrats supported STEM, party leaders have proposed alternatives that would add visas for STEM graduates and entrepreneurs without taking away another category of visas. Everyone agrees on STEM visas, so why arent we just voting on STEM visas? Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) asked during Fridays debate. The Obama administration, meanwhile, announced its opposition to the measure earlier this week, emphasizing its commitment to an immigration reform plan that creates a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the U.S. 
The Administration does not support narrowly tailored proposals that do not meet the Presidents long-term objectives with respect to comprehensive immigration reform, according to a statement.
Update  The bill received 12 fewer votes today than it did in September, when the Republicans brought it up under a suspension of the rules and needed a two-thirds vote to approve it.

Gov. Phil Bryant (R-MS)Even though the increased numbers of young women using effective forms of birth control have contributed to a steady decline in the teen birth rate over the past decade, Mississippi has retained the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the nation. At an event this week to address the issue of unintended pregnancy in the state, Gov. Phil Bryant (R) told reporters he believes that although most adolescents do know how to obtain and use contraception, the problem is teenagers do not care enough about using birth control. 
The GOP governor cited an education campaign that his administration sponsored this year as an example of the steps hes taking to address the problem:
Bryant appointed a group earlier this year to study ways to reduce teenage pregnancy, and it has also sponsored town-hall meetings in Jackson and Lexington. The group has posted several billboards around the state with a photo of a pregnant belly, complete with stretch marks, next to the slogan: Scars may fade. A baby is FOREVER. [...]
Bryant told The Daily Leader that town-hall meetings to discuss teen pregnancy are important. The road to success is in having an open, frank discussion and saying we need to stop this, Bryant said.
Bryant has said repeatedly that he believes abstinence-only is the best approach to teaching young people about sex. Its the approach thats been used for years by the school districts that already were teaching optional classes about sex education.
In fact, Bryants approach to reducing the number of unintended pregnancies in his state is directly contradictory. Even though he claims Mississippis high teen pregnancy rate is not due to a lack of education about birth control, and rather a disregard for using it, the reality is that many teens choose to forgo contraception because they are grossly misinformed about how effective it is. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about one third of teen mothers decided not to use birth control when they became sexually active because they just didnt believe they could get pregnant.
And that lack of education about effective contraception is a direct result of the abstinence-only education programs that Bryant supports. Studies have confirmed that when students arent given comprehensive, medically accurate information about how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, they end up with serious gaps in their sexual education. 
A 2011 Mississippi state law requires that some kind of gender-separated sexual education must be offered in public schools, but the school districts are split between providing abstinence-only education classes and abstinence plus classes that — while still primarily pushing shame-based abstinence messages — include some mention about some forms of contraception. Even though Bryants billboards may be trying to tell teenagers that babies are forever, young adults wont start getting the message about effectively preventing unintended pregnancy until they receive medically accurate information about it.

Yesterday, the Obama administration unveiled its proposal to avert the looming fiscal showdown. The plan included $1.6 trillion in increased taxes on the rich over the next decade, $400 billion in savings to be found in Medicare and other social programs, $50 billion in stimulus spending to begin next year, and an end to current debt ceiling rules.
This proposal is not new. It reflects the very policies Obama not only put forth in 2011, as Kevin Drum noted, but also campaigned on extensively this year. They are the very policies that the American public voted for in November when they granted Obama another four years. Exit polling also showed that 60 percent of voters wanted to see income taxes increased for wealthy Americans.
However, these facts didnt stop conservatives from acting as though Obama had proposed the Kill All The Puppies Act of 2012″. Here are five overreactions to Obamas plan:

Worse than surrender in the Civil War: Leading conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer likened Obamas proposal to the terms of surrender offered to Confederates in the Civil War, only the presidents deal was worse. Its not just a bad deal, this is really an insulting deal… Robert E. Lee was offered easier terms at Appomattox and he lost the Civil War, said Krauthammer.
Out of a fairytale: Writing in her Wall Street Journal column, Kimberley Strassel lambasted the plan as something out of Wonderland and Oz combined. She went on to argue that Obama wasnt negotiating in good faith. The most frightening aspect of the White House proposal is that it wasnt an error.
Nothing good can come of negotiating further: RedState editor Erick Erickson, whose counsel congressional Republicans regularly seek, advised the GOP to pack up, go home, and take the country over the cliff. Nothing good can come of negotiating further, Erickson wrote. The GOP should pass what they want and promptly go home. Let the Democrats stay and sort things out. Dive.
Id walk out: MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former GOP congressman, said that his Party ought to walk out of negotiations, saying Obamas proposal was solely meant to provoke House Republicans. Speaking on his morning show, Scarborough detailed what his reaction would have been had he been in negotiations: I would have said, ‘Were all busy people, this is a critical time, if youre going to come over here and insult us and intentionally try to provoke us, you can do that but Im going back to work now. And Id walk out.
Congress should dive headlong off fiscal cliff: After a lengthy column detailing how going over the fiscal cliff would shock the economy, Daily Caller editor Tucker Carlson advised GOPers to dive headlong off fiscal cliff following Obamas proposal. Republicans dont have a lot of good choices right now, Tucker wrote. They might as well try it.

Since President Obama issued an administrative directive allowing some undocumented young immigrants to temporarily remain in the country, states have adopted policies to ensure they have equal work opportunity. But on Thursday, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (R) reiterated her opposition to granting driver licenses to the eligible immigrants and compared them to children or people with a record of driving under the influence. 
Speaking on Fox News, Brewer suggested that she would never issue licenses to undocumented immigrants because thats what state law says, despite the fact that it was her executive order that interpreted state law to mean that:
BILL HEMMER (HOST): In June the White House announced a new plan if you were here in the U.S. before the age of 16, and you are younger than the age of 31, and youve been here at least five years, you can stay. That is the broad outline of his proposal passed over the summer. What youre arguing is that the law of the land in Arizona if youre illegal you dont get the same rights as those who are legal, correct?
BREWER: The state is the one who licenses the people to be able to drive, its not the federal government. And we dont license kids under 16. We dont license DUI drivers. And our laws are very clear and I took an oath to uphold that. 
Watch it:

Even if Brewer is right about what the law says, laws can be changed — in fact, two states have passed legislation allowing all undocumented immigrants to get drivers licenses, with Illinois set to be a third. These laws have been passed for reasons of public safety; lawmakers believe that unlicensed adult immigrants are likely to drive anyway because they need to get to work, risking increased accidents and higher insurance costs. Public safety concerns, of course, run the opposite direction with children and serial drunk drivers, who cannot ever be trusted to drive safely and hence must be kept off the road.
Update   A group of civil rights organizations filed a lawsuit on Thursday arguing that Brewers executive order instructing the state to refuse drivers licenses to individuals granted deferred action is unconstitutional, as it denies drivers licenses to a specific class of immigrant youth despite their being authorized to live and work in the United States.

Its the top-ten list time of year, and as Im catching up on some shows and sifting through my list of favorites, Ive been struck by how many fantastic performances weve seen in television this year. While some are obvious continuations of dominant streaks, like Bryan Cranston and Aaron Pauls turns on Breaking Bad, or Tina Feys embrace of happiness on 30 Rock, there are some truly astonishing turns going down on shows that almost no one is watching, or in shows that are so crowded with flashy performances that these are in danger of being overlooked. Here are five of the actors whose work hit me hardest this year:
1. Khandi Alexander, Treme: I ran a little behind Treme this season, but catching up on it this week, I regretted that. Much of that regret comes from how marvelous Alexander is as LaDonna Batiste-Williams. As a bar owner trying to keep her place alive, and determined to see through the prosecution of the men who robbed and sexually assaulted her, Alexander is by turns moody and joyful. Whether shes feuding with her husbands wealthy family, cooly cussing out a man demanding protection money from her, finally taking the stand in her much-delayed trial, or developing a tender friendship with Albert Lambreaux, Alexanders been given the chance to be as complete a female character as Ive seen on television in a long time. Burnt me out for nothing, she said in the season finale when her case ended in a heartbreaking mistrial. But its not nothing to those of us who have been watching at home.
2. Andra Fuller, The L.A. Complex: It is a source of considerable sadness to me that so few people found it in themselves to watch The L.A. Complex, an incredibly sharp ensemble show about what it actually takes to become successful in the entertainment industry. The cast is strong up and down the lineup, but if there was justice in the business, this should have been a breakout performance for Andra Fuller as closeted rapper Kaldrick King. King is one of the most sexual and emotional gay characters ever to appear on network television, and as he battered a young lover, made amends with him and reconnected with his father, and began a relationship with a handsome young lawyer who gave him the courage to come out, Fuller acted the hell out of every scene. 
3. Eliza Coupe, Happy Endings: I spoke to Eliza Coupe earlier this season about her approach to physical comedy, playing uptight, and being half of one of only a few interracial couples on television. Since then, her performance as Jane Kerkovich-Williams has only gotten deeper and funnier. Whether shes going overboard in enjoying being the breadwinner in her family, sneaking a perfectly-prepared turkey into her sisters house to ensure that Thanksgiving isnt a disaster, or revisiting the origin of her relationship with her husband Brad, Janes exploded the idea that being controlling means you have to be a humorless bitch, and I love her for it.
4. Charles Dance and Maisie Williams, Game of Thrones: Peter Dinklage probably has Game of Thrones‘ acting awards slot locked up as long as Tyrion Lannister lives. But thats too bad, because Dance and Williams spent this year putting on the best cross-generational acting clinic on television as Tywin Lannister and Arya Stark. Theyre people who should be mortal enemies, but, isolated from their families and in service to larger causes, find themselves understanding each other. I could watch the two of them dance around each other in Harrenhals great hall for ten hours a year.
5. Walton Goggins, Justified: Goggins, whos been everywhere from Sons of Anarchy to Lincoln this year, probably has the best shot of anyone on this list of scoring an actual Emmy nomination. As Boyd Crowder, Goggins has taken an archetype, a racist redneck, and infused the role with an injection of coal-country rage, tenderness towards his surrogate father Arlo Givens, and a spiky relationship with Arlos son Raylan, who is his sometime-enemy, sometime-ally. I cant wait to see where their rivalry heads next. Goggins was good on The Shield, but I think hes even better on Justified.

An openly straight politician publicly flaunts his sexuality
Yesterday, George W. Bush-appointed Judge Robert Jones upheld Nevadas practice of denying marriage equality to gay couples. Like a similar decision by a Reagan-appointed judge in Hawaii, Judge Jones goes out of his way to resolve any uncertainties in the law in the light most unfavorable to equality — although, in fairness to Jones, his hands were at least somewhat tied by a 22 year old anti-gay precedent.
Precedent aside, however, Jones opinion will be very difficult to defend on appeal. He attacks gay rights in ways that undermine basic protections for racial minorities and women; and he displays an almost quaint naïveté about how politicians present their sexuality to the public. By the end of the opinion, the reader is not simply left with the impression that Judge Jones has never actually met an openly gay person, but that Jones does not spend much time observing heterosexual relationships either.
The most dangerous part of Jones reasoning is a section where he claims that, because gay people made significant cultural and political progress in recent years, this somehow deprives them of their ability to seek the full protection of the Constitution:
Today, unlike in 1990, the public media are flooded with editorial, commercial, and artistic messages urging the acceptance of homosexuals. Anti-homosexual messages are rare in the national informational and entertainment media, except that anti-homosexual characters are occasionally used as foils for pro-homosexual viewpoints in entertainment media. Homosexuals serve openly in federal and state political offices. The President of the United States has announced his personal acceptance of the concept of same-sex marriage, and the announcement was widely applauded in the national media. Not only has the President expressed his moral support, he has directed the Attorney General not to defend against legal challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a federal law denying recognition to same-sex marriages at the federal level. It is exceedingly rare that a president refuses in his official capacity to defend a democratically enacted federal law in court based upon his personal political disagreements. That the homosexual-rights lobby has achieved this indicates that the group has great political power. The State of Nevada has itself outlawed sexual-orientation based discrimination as a general matter. Congress has not included the category under Title VIIs protections, however. In 2012 America, anti-homosexual viewpoints are widely regarded as uncouth.
Though it is true that Supreme Court precedents accord greater constitutional protection to groups relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process, it simply cannot be the case that a group loses its power to invoke the Constitutions guarantee of equal protection of the laws once they start to gain rights and recognition through the ordinary political process. If this were true, neither African-Americans nor women could seek shelter under the Constitution, as both race and gender equality enjoys far greater protection under federal law that the rights of LGBT Americans.

This post will be updated to reflect the growing defections.
Every day, more Republicans in Congress are backing away from Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquits anti-tax pledge. For more than 20 years, the pledge, which stipulates that those who sign will never — under any circumstance — vote to raise taxes while in Congress, has virtually been a requirement for Congressional Republicans. According to ATR, just 16 of the 234 House Republicans and 6 of the 45 Senate Republicans that comprise the 113th Congress did not sign the pledge.
However, the pledge may not have the staying power it once did. As of this writing, more than two dozen House Republicans — including Majority Leader Eric Cantor — and 11 GOP senators have distanced themselves from the pledge to one degree or another. Here are just a few examples or what members had to say:
 — Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH): The only pledge that keeps me up at night is the pledge I owe to the people of New Hampshire and our country to work as hard as I can to make sure America doesnt go bankrupt.
– Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA): I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge . . . I dont worry about that because I care too much about my country. I care a lot more about it than I do Grover Norquist.
– Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN): Well, Im not obligated on the pledge. I made Tennesseans aware, I was just elected, that the only thing Im honoring is the oath I take when Im sworn in this January.
– Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA): When I go to the constituents, its not about that pledge. Its about trying to solve problems.
– Rep. Peter King (R-NY): A pledge is good at the time you sign it . . . In 1941, I would have voted to declare war on Japan. But each Congress is a new Congress. And I dont think you can have a rule that youre never going to raise taxes or that youre never going to lower taxes. I dont want to rule anything out.
–  Rep. Timothy Johnson (R-IL): I would never in a million years have considered this as some kind of a locked-in-granite pledge. Frankly, I didnt even remember it. That shows you how obscure it was to me.
Other Senators that have signed the pledge and distanced themselves from Norquist include Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Sen. Mike Johanns (R-NE), Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN). House Republicans also jumping ship include: Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), Rep. Chris Gibson (R-NY), Rep. Reid Ribble (R-WI), Rep. Tom Latham (R-IA), Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR), Rep. Pat Meehan (R-PA), Rep. Jon Runyan (R-NJ), Rep. Lee Terry (R-NE), Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE), Rep. Charles Boustany (R-LA), Rep. Charlie Bass (R-NH), Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID), Rep. John Kline (R-MN), Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-MN), Rep. Chip Cravaack (R-MN), Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE), Rep. Scott Rigell (R-VA), Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY), Rep. Allen West (R-FL), Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL), Rep. Howard Buck McKeon (R-CA), Rep. Howard Coble (R-NC), Rep. John Campbell (R-CA), Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-TN), Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE), Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R-CA), Rep. Steve LaTourette (R-OH), Rep. Dan Webster (R-FL), and Rep. Tom Rooney (R-FL).

Rep. Steve King (R-IA)Since President Obamas re-election and Mitt Romneys poor performance among Hispanic voters, a number of prominent conservative lawmakers and commentators have come out in favor of immigration reform. But Rep. Steve King (R-IA) appears to have not gotten the memo, if his first comments on immigration since the election are any indication.
Echoing Mitt Romneys now-infamous complaint that Obama won by handing out gifts to women and minorities, King told radio host Janet Mefferd yesterday that Republicans should not fixate on winning back the Hispanic vote because Democrats can always counter offer with a great big check. Right Wing Watch and Huffington Posts Nick Wing picked up the exchange:
JANET MEFFERD: How in the world do you out-left the left anyway? If we go to the left on amnesty, do you think the Democrats are going to sit still and just go ‘oh I guess that theyre more caring than we are? Its a zero-sum game. I dont know how in the world the Republicans expect to get votes when the Democrats are already farther along than we are.
STEVE KING: Theres no possible way. Whatever we might say we are going to do, reduce the enforcement of the rule of law, waive the rule of law, Democrats will find a way to hand deliver citizenship papers along with a great big check from money borrowed from the Chinese.
King has already amassed quite the record of derogatory comments towards hispanic immigrants, suggesting failure to pass voter ID laws would turn this country over to undocumented immigrants, and once analogizing immigrants to birddogs — then later claiming the latter was a compliment. King has also threatened to sue President Obama for his executive policy forgoing deportation for the 1.4 million young immigrants who would be eligible for the DREAM Act.
King closed out the discussion of the Republicans relation to Hispanics by lamenting that the election really was about expanding the dependency class in america. More americans voted fore dependency, less voted for personal responsibility. And you dont beat Santa Clause with amnesty.

Two winning tickets for this weeks $587.5 million Powerball lottery were sold, one each in Missouri and Arizona. Of course, state governments will be receiving a share of the pot via the taxes imposed on lottery winnings.
Missouri state budget director Linda Luebbering said the revenue would have a good, positive effect for her state. About 35 percent of the money dedicated to lotteries eventually winds up back in state coffers.
Many states use lotteries as a way to raise money, often dedicating the revenue to education. However, research has found that states using lotteries to boost their education spending actually end up putting less money into classrooms than states that simply budget appropriately for their schools:
The educational bonus appears to be nonexistent. Miller and Pierce (1997) studied the short- and long-term effect of education lotteries. They found that lottery states did indeed increase per-capita spending on education during the lotterys early years. However, after some time these states actually decreased their overall spending on education. In contrast, states without lotteries increased education spending over time. In fact, nonlottery states spend, on average, 10 percent more of their budgets on education than lottery states (Gearey 1997).
The Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government actually found that new gambling operations that are intended to pay for normal increases in general state spending may add to, rather than ease, state budget imbalances.
Lotteries are also extremely detrimental to the poor, acting as, in essence, a regressive tax, with about a 38 percent tax rate (a rate usually reserved for the very richest Americans). Lotteries are the worst expected return of just about any gambling you can do, said economist Victor Matheson, who estimates that where slots pay 95 cents to the dollar in terms of prizes and a good Black Jack player can earn as much as 98 cents, lotteries pay a mere 50- to 60-cent return per dollar. According to the Bloomberg News Sucker Index, residents of Georgia do the most damage to their own finances through the lottery.

When word came down in August that Guardians of the Galaxy, the planned 2014 Marvel movie about an oddball group of superheroes including an interstellar raccoon and a talking tree, was actually a backdoor introduction of Carol Danvers, the badass Air Force pilot who is now Captain Marvel, I was ridiculously excited. Its long past time that Marvel added a female superhero (as opposed to simply a well-trained human woman) to the on-screen Avengers lineup, Danvers military pedigree would lend her some interesting synergy with Captain America, and shed be a fascinating way to get a well-credentialed action actress like Katee Sackhoff into the franchise. But since folks have uncovered an old blog post by James Gunn, who is both writing and directing the movie, Ive gone from enthusiastic about the project to straight-up terrified about it.
The post is Gunn reporting the results of a poll he did with readers about which superheroes theyd like to have sex with. It was deleted—and you can see why—but its available in Google Cache. And while I dont necessarily oppose the idea of this kind of poll—superheroes are designed to be fantasies—the way Gunn wrote up the results reveals some pretty horrifying ideas about superheroines, both inside the bedroom and outside of it. 
On Emma Frost, described as the woman of choice for those men who love rude bitches, Gunn says What I love about Emma is the practical attire she wears while adventuring.  Certainly, if I were a woman fighting giant monsters Id want to wear some awesome breast-mushing halter top, a pair of panties, and thigh highs. On my beloved She-Hulk, I ever were in the mood to be dominated and treated like a little bitch, by someone who is green, then She-Hulk would almost certainly be the way to go. Then theres this little bon mot Disco Dazzler, Rave Dazzler, and Punk Rock Dazzler, they all have one thing in common – a friggin GREAT vagina. On Kitty Pryde: I wrote her back [on Twitter], but neglected to mention that I wanted to anally do her. I wont even mind if Lockheed is in the room, staring at me with a creepy look the whole time. Theres slut-shaming of Batgirl: Being a teen mom and all, you know shes easy. Go for it. There are nasty objectification fantasies, like this one of Spider-Woman: The whole time Im fucking her I cant get her face out of my mind as the Skrull leader who tried to conquer the world. I know its not her fault, but I just cant help it. So I finish on her face to help block out the painful memories. A lot of this woman is messed-up so shes sexy, a la Cassandra Cain: Cassandras father taught her how to kill people when she was eight.  Which means she has the ultimate daddy issues. Which means shes just my type. 
Then, theres the charming homophobia! On Gambit: My girlfriend voted for this Cajun fruit. I think shes looking to have a devils three way with the two of us.  The idea of my balls slapping against Gambits makes me sick to my stomach. The charming observation of Batwoman that This lesbian character was voted for almost exclusively by men. I dont know exactly what that means.  But Im hoping for a Marvel-DC crossover so that Tony Stark can turn her.  She could also have sex with Nightwing and probably still be technically considered a lesbian.
Maybe it should be comfort to us that of his potential heroine, Carol Danvers, Gunn only says Carol Danvers dropped 13 points from her position last year.  Its a surprise to me as she is, along with Emma Frost and the Black Cat, one of the most consistently sexualized characters in the Marvel Universe, though if he thinks her sexualization is one of the more telling things about her character, the fact that he doesnt have specific fantasies about her may not count for very much. One of the most telling remarks Gunn makes is about Starfire: The picture above is why, by the age of nine or ten, comic books had ruined real women for me forever. In this post, he repeatedly mentions his girlfriend, so that doesnt seem entirely true. But I do think that he and Disney should have to explain why these kinds of attitudes havent ruined him from being the kind of person whos actually suited to introduce the first Marvel superheroine to an audience that includes men who are capable of reading superwomen as more than templates for sexual fantasies, and women who are eager to see themselves reflected on screen.

Hurricane Sandy victims struggle to keep warm after losing heat in their homeSuperstorm Sandy tore through the East Coast at the end of October, leaving significant damage and serious public threats in its wake — and now, a month and a presidential election later, some Americans still arent completely out of danger even though the news cycle has largely moved on.
The New York City Health Department is warning medical providers that although power has been restored in the city, thousands of New Yorkers are still living without heat in their homes, resulting in a soaring number of recent hypothermia cases. In the weeks after Sandy hit, cold exposure sent three times as many people to the emergency room compared to the same period in November between 2008 and 2011. And public health officials are worried that the problem will worsen in the upcoming winter months:
The department warned health care providers that residents living in unheated homes faced a significant risk of serious illness and death from multiple causes. [...]
And as temperatures dip, health officials said the cold could lead to other health problems, including a worsening of heart and lung diseases and an increase in anxiety and depression.
My bigger concern is what happens in the future as we get closer to winter in the next four weeks, Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the citys health commissioner, said in an interview. There are probably about 12,000 people living in unheated apartments right now.
Some people still living without heat are turning to ovens or gas-fueled space heaters, but public health officials advise against those temporary solutions because of the increased risk of fire and carbon monoxide poisoning. Without proper ventilation, back-up generators can cause unsafe levels of carbon monoxide in the air — and sure enough, in the week after Sandy, the number of cases of potentially fatal carbon monoxide exposure was more than 10 times higher than average, and 6 times as high the following week. The citys health department also reported that calls to New York Citys poison center have increased over the past month.
New Yorkers increased risk of health dangers is especially problematic because the citys hospital system is not yet operating at full capacity after the superstorm seriously damaged several medical facilities, forcing some hospitals that flooded and lost power to evacuate their patients to different locations. The director of trauma at Bellevue Hospital — New Yorks flagship public hospital, which had to spread its staff and patients across other buildings after Sandy devastated its own facilities — told ProPublica that even though hospital staff has been holding it together so far to continue caring for their patients, the current status of care in Manhattan is not sustainable for any length of time.
Nevertheless, health care workers have been vigilant in working overtime to care for their patients, even in the compromised conditions brought about by Hurricane Sandy. With the fall months fading into winter, their work may not be done quite yet.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) called on President Obama and Democrats to specify entitlement cuts that could balance their desires for tax increases in a hypothetical deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, even though only Republicans have demanded spending cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security. Despite their support for putting entitlement programs on the chopping block, GOP lawmakers have refused to specify how, or by how much, they would cut the programs.
Boehner, instead, used a press conference today to urge Democrats to take the lead on entitlements, even though Obama and Democratic leaders made it clear that they would not support a deal that cut Social Security, and Democrats have repeatedly opposed the Medicare changes Republicans have attempted to make in the past:
BOEHNER: There has been no serious discussion of spending cuts so far. And unless there is, there is a real danger of going off the fiscal cliff. [...] So right now all eyes are on the White House…Its time for the President, Congressional Democrats to tell the American people what spending cuts theyre willing to make. 
Q: Why will you not tell Democrats, what specific spending cuts you would like to see, especially within entitlements?
BOEHNER: Its been very clear over the last year and a half. Ive talked to the President about many of them. You can look at our budget, where we outlined very specific proposals, where we passed in last years budget and the budget from the year before. We know what the menu is, what we dont know is what the White house is willing to do to get serious about solving our debt crisis. 
Q: So your 2011 position still stands, then? I mean, are you still offering, those talks from 2011, is that still the basis here?
BOEHNER: Listen, Im not going to get into the details, but its very clear what kind of spending cuts need to occur, but we have no idea what the White House is willing to do. 

The entitlement cuts Boehner and the Republicans have already approved, like turning Medicare into a voucher program, are vastly unpopular with Americans, who have long opposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security (past polls, in fact, have shown that they prefer increases in the programs). Recent polling shows that even Republican voters oppose Medicare cuts. Americans rejected the Republican Medicare plan during the 2012 election, when losing vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan insisted that the GOP could win the debate about specific changes to the program.
Democrats, meanwhile, have already passed reforms to strengthen Medicare — Obamas health care law cut $716 billion and lengthened the programs life by eight years, according to the Congressional Budget Office — and Democratic senators have proposed legislation that would extend the life of Social Security, while also increasing benefits for all recipients. Republicans opposed the Medicare cuts in Obamacare and have not shown a willingness to support Democratic proposals on Social Security.

The old adage that all press is good press might not ring true with department store chain Macys. Their recent partnership with conservative billionaire oddball Donald Trump is causing a sudden drop in the brands popularity, particularly among women.
According to a YouGov Brandindex survey, immediately after the Macys-Trump partnership, women steadily became far less likely to recommend Macys to their friends. In the same period, other brands like JCPenney actually performed better than usual:

Nearly 675,000 people have signed a petition asking Macys not to partner with Trump, citing his extremist political positions: Trump called for revolution after President Obama won re-election, has been a leader in the so-called birther movement, and called global climate change a concept created by and for the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.
Or perhaps its the more overtly sexist things Trump is known for that make him such a terrible partner for Macys: He recently offered to expose his genitals to a woman, played rate the women with contestants on his reality TV show, and in 1991 he told Esquire magazine, it doesnt really matter what [the media] write as long as youve got a young and beautiful piece of [expletive]. 
Macys has stood by its decision to partner with Trump, saying, Macys marketing and merchandise offerings are not representative of any political position.

From the founding of the Republic until the beginning of the current Congress, the Senate voted to break a filibuster on a presidents nominee only 89 times. Nearly one quarter of all of these were Senate Republican filibusters of President Obamas nominees. No senate minority in American history was as aggressive in filibustering presidential nominees as the minority led by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
Lest there be any doubt, this kind of obstructionism does far more than simply frustrate President Obama — it denies the American people a fully functioning government and discourages the most talented potential nominees from seeking government jobs in the first place. Here are just a few of the most exceptional nominees blocked by the Senates nonsensical filibuster rules:
1) Peter Diamond (Federal Reserve Board of Governors)

In 2010, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) placed a hold on MIT Economics Professor Peter Diamonds nomination to the Federal Reserve Board because he deemed Diamond too unqualified to sit on the board. A few months later, Diamond won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Nevertheless, Shelby clung to his efforts to keep Diamond off the Fed board, and the Nobel Prize winning economist eventually withdrew his nomination. In an op-ed explaining his withdraw, Diamond warned that we should all worry about how distorted the confirmation process has become, and how little understanding of monetary policy there is among some of those responsible for its Congressional oversight. . . . Skilled analytical thinking should not be drowned out by mistaken, ideologically driven views that more is always better or less is always better. I had hoped to bring some of my own expertise and experience to the Fed. Now I hope someone else can.
2) Joseph Smith (Federal Housing Finance Agency)

In November 2010, President Obama nominated Joseph A. Smith Jr., then North Carolinas longtime Commissioner of Banks, to head the independent FHFA. Though the Senate Banking Committee overwhelmingly endorsed his nomination, on a 16-6 vote, Senate Republicans blocked a confirmation vote and scuttled his nomination by running out the clock. Sen. Richard Shelbys (R-AL), fearing Smith might help underwater homeowners with mortgage principal reductions, opposed him and called him a tool of the administration, cutting mortgages, throwing the bill to the taxpayers. As a result of this obstruction, FHFA Acting Director Edward DeMarco — the deputy to President George W. Bushs director — continues to run the agency and has single-handedly blocked White House mortgage debt relief efforts. More than a quarter of Americans with home mortgages are currently underwater, owing more to the lender than their property is currently worth.
3) Caitlin Halligan (United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit)

Caitlin Halligan is one of the nations best attorneys. Halligan is a former Supreme Court law clerk, a former Solicitor General of the state of New York, the former head of appellate litigation at one of the nations top law firms and is currently general counsel for one of the largest prosecutors offices in the country. Halligan taught constitutional law at Columbia Law School. She received the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association. And her nomination to the federal bench enjoys the support of some of the nations top Supreme Court advocates, many of whom are Republicans. Yet her nomination has languished for more than two years despite the fact that Senate Republicans have barely even managed to articulate a case against Halligans confirmation. Indeed, the best her opponents have come up with is a complaint that she argued positions the National Rifle Association disagrees with on behalf of her former client — the state of New York. Apparently, the NRA gets to veto judges now.
4) John J. Sullivan (Federal Election Commission)

In 2009, when President Obama nominated Sullivan , a respected labor lawyer, to replace a Democratric FEC Commissioner whose term expired two years earlier, his nomination received praise from campaign finance reform advocates and opponents. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee unanimously recommended his nomination, with the panels top Republican endorsing Sullivan as eminently well-qualified for this position. Though neither actually opposed the nomination, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and then-Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) placed a hold on the nomination — essentially announcing their intention to force a time-consuming cloture vote with a 60 vote super-majority threshold — demanding the administration also replace other members of the gridlocked Commission. After 15 months without a vote, Sullivan asked the White House to withdraw his nomination and lamented a broken system. The problem with cloture, Sullivan noted, is not the vote but the amount of floor time it takes in the Senate. It is an incredible distraction to occupy the Senate with a nomination like mine with so many other pressing matters on the floor. Two years later, not one of the five FEC commissioners serving on expired terms has been replaced.
5) Dawn Johnsen (Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel)

Before even taking the oath of office, President Obama announced that Dawn Johnsen, an outspoken opponent of torture, would lead the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). In this role, she would lead the same office that produced the infamous torture memos justifying this illegal practice during the Bush Administration. Johnsen headed the same office during the Clinton Administration, and she co-authored a set of principles for future OLC attorneys to ensure that a repeat of the torture memos did not occur. Senate Republicans filibustered her nomination, fixating in their rhetoric on her record as an attorney defending abortion rights before she entered government service, but Johnsen herself suspected a difference motive. In a 2011 interview, Johnsen indicated that she was blocked in an attempt to score political points against Obamas approach to terrorism.
Bonus: Richard Cordray (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)
In July 2011, President Obama nominated Cordray, a former Ohio Attorney General, to be the first-ever director of the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A group of 44 Senate Republicans immediately announced that they would refuse to vote for Cordray or any nominee for the position, unless the independent agency was first defanged. That December, 45 Republicans blocked an up-or-down-vote on Cordrays nomination, even though he had majority support and Republican opponents admitted he was qualified. President Obama recess appointed Cordray in January, but that only runs through the end of 2013.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said on Wednesday that she would have a hard time supporting U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice as the next Secretary of State because she is concerned about Rices credibility in the aftermath of presenting what turned out to be an inaccurate portrayal of the Sept. 11 Benghazi terror attacks. Yet, Collins was not at all concerned about President Bushs decision to nominate Condoleezza Rice as the nations top diplomat, despite her role in presenting false information that provided the justification for the U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
Appearing on CNN, Collins hammered home various GOP talking points about concerns that Rice may have acted overly political in providing an overview of the Obama administrations knowledge in the aftermath of the attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, and said that damaged Rices credibility to be the top State Department official: 
COLLINS: Its important that the secretary of state enjoy credibility around the world with Congress and here in our country as well. And I am concerned that Susan Rices credibility may have been damaged by the misinformation that was presented that day. Thats one reason, as I said, that I wish she had just told the White House no, you should send a political person to be on those Sunday shows.
Watch it:

Collins statements throughout the day on Wednesday, on CNN and elsewhere, leave several questions unanswered. The first is why the focus on a nominees judgement is so much more important now than in 2004 and 2005. Shortly after President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to be the next Secretary of State in November, 2004, Collins praised the move, saying Bush made a very good choice. Collins, in turn, voted for her confirmation along with almost all of her Republican colleagues. 
Condoleezza Rice had spent many months prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq convincing the public of the threat that Saddam Husseins alleged weapons of mass destruction program presented to the United States, including famously stating that we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud. Her statements led the U.S. into a war in Iraq that will end up costing the U.S. trillions of dollars and leaving tens of thousands dead or wounded. We knew by the time Condoleezza Rice was nominated that there were no WMDs in Iraq. 
Another question to ask is why Rices name is now being brought up in relation to a set of Embassy bombings from 14 years ago. Collins earlier on Wednesday said, What troubles me so much is the Benghazi attack in many ways echoes the attacks on those embassies in 1998, when Susan Rice was head of the African region for our State Department.

Fast food workers in New York City are launching a strike today, ahead of the largest unionization drive to ever hit the industry. The walkouts began at 6:30 this morning at a McDonalds, as workers protest what they said were low wages and retaliation against several workers who have backed the unionization campaign.
Workers in the fast food industry have every reason to be upset. As the National Employment Law Project detailed in a report earlier this year, some of the largest fast food chains — including McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell — are some of the largest employers of low-wage workers, but are making huge profits as the nation emerges from the Great Recession:
The three largest low‐wage employers in the United States – Wal‐Mart, Yum! Brands (the operator of fast food chains Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC), and McDonalds – offer a revealing look at the resiliency of low‐wage employers in the post‐recession economy.
Each of these corporations was profitable during all of the last three fiscal years, and each of them now earns profits that are substantially higher than their pre‐recession levels.

One in four workers is expected to be in low-wage industries over the next decade, and a majority of the jobs added since the recession have been low-wage jobs. Also, as Sarah Jaffe noted in the Atlantic, these jobs are not being done by teenagers. Across the country, the median age of fast-food workers is over 28, and women — who make up two-thirds of the industry — are over 32, she wrote. If these workers are going to make a living, a strike and unionizing may be the only way to make it happen.

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX)As if it werent enough that members of the Republican Party spent much of President Obamas first term accusing him of being a crypto-Manchurian Candidate who was born in Kenya, one GOP congressman is floating a new conspiracy theory: Obama only helped oust former Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi so al-Qaeda could take over.
Appearing on Frank Gaffneys anti-Muslim radio show, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) launched into a lengthy tirade criticizing the Obama administrations decision to provide air support in the international campaign against Qaddafi last year. Rather than acknowledging that Obama launched the mission to stave off a looming massacre in Misrata, the Texas Republican saw a hidden, pernicious reason for the intervention. This administration sent planes and bombs and support to oust Qaddafi so that al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood could take over Libya, said Gohmert.
GOHMERT: What was all the rage a year and a half ago? It was the Arab Spring and how wonderful it was! This administration really embraced blowing out Mubarak – yes, do it up by all means – getting rid of Qaddafi, it wasnt enough to send verbal accolades, this administration sent planes and bombs and support to oust Qaddafi so that al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood could take over Libya.
Listen to it:

After accusing Obama of harboring hidden sympathy for al-Qaeda — a group whose leader Osama bin Laden was killed in a mission ordered by Obama — Gohmert went on to say that the president of helping jumpstart a new Ottoman Empire in the Middle East.

 Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) became the public face of vote suppression this year for his overreaching election directives, which restricted early voting hours and forbid election officials from counting legitimate votes. Though President Obama won the state, Husted has not halted his efforts. With two House races heading to a recount, Husted is now facing accusations that he is illegally tossing provisional ballots. These House races will determine whether state Republicans get a super-majority to put constitutional amendments on the ballot without a single Democratic vote.
State representatives Kathleen Clyde (D-OH) and Debbie Phillips (D-OH) threatened to sue Wednesday evening over at least 384 ballots that have been discarded in the two districts in question, Tuscarawas and Cuyahoga. According to the state reps, some ballots were put in plain manila envelopes instead of provisional ballot envelopes, rendering them invalid. Additionally, they say Husted is rejecting ballots covered under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which allows voters who have moved to a different address within the same congressional district to vote at their former precinct.
Even more ballots are likely to have been wrongly discarded because officials are using a database already proven to be flawed and incomplete to determine the voters registration status.
Besides these possible breaches of federal election law, Husted is also tossing innumerable ballots that were thrown into question by poll worker error through no fault of the voter. A federal judge tried to stop him, declaring I dont want to see democracy die in the darkness on my watch. But the conservative Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay that allowed Husted to throw out these votes.
Ohio leads the country in provisional ballots, with 200,000 cast this year. In 2008, the state discarded 1 out of every 5 provisional votes. These ballots are often concentrated in urban, Democratic areas — and huge percentages get discarded every election.

Pastor Rick Warren  admitted on CNN on Thursday that Evangelical churches are at least partly responsible for some of the negative attitudes towards gay and lesbian people. 
Appearing on Starting Point to promote an updated version of his book, A Purpose Driven Life, Warren reiterated his opposition to recognizing same-sex couples. But asked about the suicide of Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi — who committed suicide after his roommate broadcast a video of him with another man — the pastor said that Jesus teaches Christians not to hate anybody and admitted that some churches fall short of this responsibility: 

JOHN BERMAN (HOST): [Tyler Clementis] parents wrote that they left their Evangelical church recently because they felt the beliefs on homosexuality estranged them from their son, which meant he could not come to them. His mother said this, she said, ‘at this point, I think Jesus is more about reconciliation and love. He spoke more about divorce than homosexuality, but you can be divorced and join a church more than you can be gay and join churches.
WARREN: Very good point. You know, Jesus taught, as a Christian, I am not allowed to hate anybody. Im not allowed to do that. In fact, I am commanded by Jesus Christ to love everyone, to show respect to everyone. Theres a difference between acceptance and approval. God accepts me, accepts you unconditionally. He doesnt approve of everything we do.
BERMAN: But pastor, dont you think some of our churches are responsible for some of the attitudes towards gays in America, the negative attitudes?
WARREN: Probably, yeah. In fact, there are some people who are extremely violent or hateful. And hate is never of God, never.

Watch it: 

On Wednesday, during an interview with HuffPost Lives Marc Lamont Hill, Warren attempted to downplay his endorsement for Proposition 8, Californias constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, claiming that he intended to communicate his private support to church members and was not trying to take a public position on the issue. Warren expressed regret for ever backing the measure, though that hasnt stopped him from dismissing gay and lesbian relationships. 
Earlier this week, Warren said that acting on same-sex attractions is no different from punching a guy in the nose or consuming arsenic.

While Washington obsesses over the so-called fiscal cliff — the set of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take place at the end of the year — Americas unemployed are facing a cliff of a different kind. In January, the expanded federal unemployment insurance program will expire, cutting off benefits for millions of Americans.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, extending unemployment insurance wont just help those Americans struggling to find work in a still-sluggish economy. It will also help create 300,000 jobs:
For the three options involving extensions for an entire year—Options 1, 2, and 4—economic output would be $1.10 higher per dollar of budgetary cost, on average, in 2013, CBO estimates, and employment would be increased by six years of full-time-equivalent employment per million dollars of budgetary cost (see figure below).
Under Option 1 [a full, year-long extension], for example, which extends the benefits provided under the current EUC and EB programs at a total budgetary cost of $30 billion, CBO estimates that gross domestic product adjusted for inflation would be 0.2 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 2013 and that full-time-equivalent employment would be 0.3 million higher at that time than it would be under current law. 
Unemployment insurance kept 2.3 million people out of poverty last year, despite Americas system being one of the stingiest in the developed world. Already, 500,000 Americans have lost benefits due to the programs faulty design and Congress restricting eligibility. (HT: Matt OBrien)
