                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                             

Earlier this week on The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O'Reilly and Charles Krauthammer came to the same -- and obvious -- conclusion as to why the Obama White House felt compelled to misrepresent the events at Benghazi on September 11.  As O'Reilly noted, the administration hoped "to tamp the story down so it didn't intrude on their narrative that the Obama administration had decimated al-Qaeda." 
"The real story would have gone against the narrative," Krauthammer agreed, adding, "I'm not saying that there was a deliberate conspiracy from day one, but as this story unfolded, they saw a way to make this non-political."
Sixteen years ago, also in the home stretch of a difficult re-election campaign, Bill Clinton faced a problem very similar to Obama's.  An event took place that threatened the "peace and prosperity" theme of his campaign -- specifically, the July 17, 1996, shoot-down of TWA Flight 800, with 230 people on board, just 10 miles off the coast of Long Island. 
I use the word "shoot-down" with total confidence.  Along with investigative reporter James Sanders, I produced a video on the subject called Silenced and wrote a book called First Strike.  In a sense, Sanders was the Nakoula Basseley Nakoula of this event.  To prevent Sanders from reporting on the story, the FBI arrested him and his wife Elizabeth and convicted both of conspiracy.  As with Nakoula, the nation's civil libertarians chose not to notice.
It was the Sanderses' story, especially Elizabeth's, that first got me interested in the case four years after TWA Flight 800 went down.  A reluctant conspiracy theorist, I read everything I could find on the crash before I agreed to do the video.  By this time, the NTSB hearings had played out.  The evidence for a missile strike was overwhelming to any dispassionate observer.  So was the evidence of a cover-up.
Although the word was not used back then, the Clinton White House, with the help of a complicit media, rewrote the event's "narrative" to assure re-election.  Again, as with Benghazi, that narrative was clumsily improvised almost on a daily basis.  Knowing the media had his back, Clinton responded much as Obama did: deny, obfuscate, and kick the investigatory can down the road until after the election.
One central figure appeared in each drama: Hillary Clinton.  She stood by Obama's side in the Rose Garden on September 12 as he spun reality into confection.  She, Bill, and Sandy Berger holed themselves up in the White House family quarters, assessing their narrative options throughout that long night of July 17, 1996.
On that fateful night, FAA air traffic controllers saw an unknown object "merge" with the doomed 747 seconds before it exploded, and they rushed the tape to the White House.  Hundreds of people saw what the controllers did from the ground.  FBI witness No. 73, an aviation buff, watched a "red streak" with a "light gray smoke trail" move up toward the airliner and then go "past the right side and above the aircraft before arcking [sic] back down toward the aircrafts [sic] right wing."  She even reported the actual breakup sequence before the authorities figured it out on their own.
High-school principal Joseph Delgado told the FBI that he had seen an object like "a firework" ascend "fairly quick," then "slow" and "wiggle," then "speed up" and get "lost."  Then he saw a second object that "glimmered" in the sky, higher than the first, then a red dot move up to that object, then a puff of smoke, then another puff, then a "firebox."  He drew a precise image of the same for the FBI.
Mike Wire, a no-nonsense millwright and U.S. Army vet, watched events unfold from the Beach Lane Bridge in Westhampton on Long Island.  Wire had seen a white light traveling skyward from the ground at approximately a 40-degree angle, sparkling and zigzagging before culminating in a massive fireball.
In a confidential taped interview with historian Taylor Branch on August 2, 1996, Clinton laid the blame for the presumed missile attack on Iran.  "They want war," he told Branch.  Clinton may or may not have been lying, but he did not want to mess with Iran, at least not right before an election he already had in the bag.
To control the post-crash narrative, the White House allowed the FBI to talk only to The New York Times.  Four weeks after the disaster, the Times would report, "Now that investigators say they think the center fuel tank did not explode, they say the only good explanations remaining are that a bomb or a missile brought down the plane."
A missile attack was too obvious and ominous.  So a week later, likely under White House pressure, and without any new evidence, the FBI shifted its storyline fully away from a missile to a bomb.  "Prime Evidence Found That Device Exploded in Cabin of Flight 800," reported the Times above the fold on August 23, just a few days before the Democratic National Convention.  The Times reached this conclusion by interviewing exactly none of the 270 FBI eyewitnesses to a likely missile strike.  Sanders and I interviewed scores of them.
But even this scenario threatened the peace and prosperity message to be promoted at the Democratic National Convention just days away.  And so the story was allowed to die.  For the next three weeks, there was no meaningful reporting at all.
In mid-September, two months after the crash, the FBI shifted the narrative once again from a bomb to a center fuel tank explosion, a possibility that had been ruled out a month earlier.  The other media unquestioningly followed the Times.  They too had a president to re-elect.
"Stories damaging to the media's preferred candidates are never tied together into a coherent narrative," writes John Hayward in an insightful Human Events article on Benghazi.  "You don't see links drawn between Event A, Speech B, and Subcommittee Hearing C.  You're not constantly reminded of inconvenient things the beloved candidate said last year, last month, or last week."
So it was with TWA Flight 800.  No one in the media saw fit to ask what happened to the "prime evidence" of August 23 or the "only good explanations" of August 14 or of Clinton's "they want war" of August 2.
As each week passed, even the Clintons had to be stunned that so obvious a truth remained so thoroughly ignored.  To sustain the lie, however, insiders had to tell more lies still.
The FBI would fabricate a second interview with Witness No. 73 that never took place.
The CIA -- yes, that CIA-- would fabricate a second interview with Mike Wire that also never took place.  NTSB insiders would lie outright about what Joseph Delgado saw, but the election came and went without anyone even knowing who these people were.
In 1996, however, there was no ubiquitous internet, no Facebook, no YouTube.  Fox News came online only later that year.  It would have been impossible for any White House to pull this massive a misdirection off in 2012 so close to home.  America would have seen videos of the shoot-down online before the White House could control the information flow.
In 2012, Obama had the advantage of geography.  No helpful citizens fixed their smartphones on the destruction of the American consulate in Benghazi.  He had the advantage also of a major media sixteen years more corrupt than in 1996
Obama had the disadvantage, however, of serving in a fully interactive age.  The added scrutiny has made Obama's attempt to bury the story seem obvious and amateurish by comparison to Clinton's -- at least to those who are paying attention.  Unfortunately, those paying attention include not a single major media reporter.

There will be no short term solution to the problem now facing Western civilization in general, and America in particular.  Modern leftist authoritarians and their intellectual progenitors have created a special historical circumstance from which recovery must be painful, slow, and often heartbreaking -- namely, the complete breakdown of the shared birthright of reason and character which has traditionally allowed nations to forge ahead on common ground in the aftermath of even the most violent eruptions.
There is a fond hope in some conservative circles that the inevitable destructiveness of Obama's second term will deliver a broke and broken populace straight into the arms of the kind of common sense conservatism that promises a return to financial stability and civil order, or even into a "second American Revolution." Attractive as this hope may be, its plausibility depends on a number of societal conditions that are unmet in present circumstances.
Allow me to preface my argument against this dream of a leftist implosion by emphasizing that I mean to be neither a doomsayer nor a naysayer.  Rather, I certainly believe there is a path to civilizational renewal -- there always is -- but not one likely to fit a neat pattern or short term game plan.  Far from any contrarian intentions, throwing the cold light of reason on our dearest wishes helps us to understand the nature and extent of the challenge before us, a necessary first step towards the ultimate victory we will certainly win.  Now to the point.
The historical precedent implied in the prediction of socialist self-destruction is not applicable to today's situation.  The typical expression of this precedent goes something like this: "Centralized control fails every time it is tried; ergo, it will fail again in America."  From this precedent, so the argument goes, it follows that America's collapse under socialism will produce popular grounds for a gradual revival of liberty.
This reasoning is doubtful on two fronts.  For one thing, while history shows that socialism does indeed fail, it does not show that this failure always leads to a revival of liberty.  The Soviet economy collapsed.  The empire dissolved.  Successive Russian leaders loosened restrictions on private economic activity.  Now Russia has Vladimir Putin, a "democratically elected" KGB dictator for life.  If there is a lesson here, it is one very familiar to American conservatives, namely that thugs and demagogues can exploit a failed economy.
China, learning from Russia's mistakes, pulled itself out of communist stagnation by ingeniously intuiting that mere relative liberty can unleash private aspirations powerful enough to sustain economic activity.  Thus, a land without property rights, freedom of speech, or political pluralism has manufactured enough ersatz "economic freedom" to invigorate the dormant profit motive in the hearts of the Chinese.  The Chinese Communist Party has mass produced "Capitalism: The Parlor Game," and so far that superficial simulacrum of liberty has engendered real world economic results. 
It remains to be seen whether the effects of this brilliant psychological manipulation can last.  Europe has been functioning on a similar model of carefully regulated business activity permitted within an increasingly oppressive political apparatus for decades now -- with the added Brave New World (Order) cleverness of substituting moral permissiveness for political freedom -- and we are beginning to see the ultimate outcome: an infantilized public employee population screaming for more speed from the back seat as Ãber-Daddy takes the EU car careering off a cliff and towards a thousand-year descent into the black.
What few cases one can cite of truly revitalized former leftist authoritarian states were buttressed in their recovery by the direct political and economic assistance, as well as the indirect example, of the United States.  This is a key point.  The failure of socialism is relative.  Without a point of stark comparison, failure is less recognizable.  Poverty must have a point of reference against which it can be judged as poverty.  This, of course, is the main reason modern totalitarian states have always tried to restrict access to the outside world, and to erase their own national history -- they do not want their suffering subjects to see what might have been. 
As for the socialist authoritarians themselves, we must not fall into the trap of judging radical leftists as if they think like decent or reasonable people.  (The "well-creased-pant-leg-means-he'll-make-a-good-president" fallacy.)  What you and I judge as societal failure is, to them, of little consequence in and of itself.  For general prosperity is not their goal.  In short, the intellectual leaders of the left know as well as you do that their regulatory state with its confiscatory taxation, propagandistic education, and morally subversive cultural elite will not produce prosperity and individual happiness, i.e., that their regime will "fail" the true test of good government.  In the authoritarian's eyes, however, the only failure that matters is the loss of his power.  With no clear external examples of freer, more prosperous nations, American authoritarians will not face the stress of competing models against which their rule may be judged and found wanting.  They will never be put on the spot to justify their oppression with practical results.  When the U.S. economy collapses, it will take the world with it.  There will be nowhere to go.  And there will be no light to look to for hope.
The second major problem with our hopes that a phoenix of American liberty will rise from the ashes of Obama era statism can most easily be seen by looking again at the example of those former Soviet bloc nations, such as Poland or the Czech Republic, that have managed to exhibit some allegiance to the idea of freedom in the aftermath of Russian oppression.  The key point of comparison is precisely the fact that these countries were invaded and occupied by external aggressors. 
Much was done by the invading force to subvert and undermine traditional ways and ideas, of course, and to inculcate a communist sensibility.  Artists were seduced into the leftist cause, the bureaucracy was trained in the methods of intimidation and forced "compliance" -- a word that is now used very proudly and comfortably by all U.S. federal agencies -- and the ruling elite was purged of resisters and holdovers from the pre-Soviet era. 
And yet the basic fact of having been invaded and perverted by force from without created a natural undercurrent of resistance in the population.  Had the Soviet occupation lasted a few more generations, all remnants of the pre-existing society might have vanished completely.  Fortunately, the imposed dictatorship lasted no longer than the single lifespan of some of the oppressed citizens.  The memory, morals, and psychology of a pre-communist world were preserved, albeit in a damaged and weakened form.
In the case of America and the rest of the West, the leftist superstructure (to borrow the appropriately Marxist terminology) is not generally perceived as having been imposed from without.  Rather, it has grown from seed within the modern West itself, carefully cultivated by successive generations of an anti-individualist educational elite, an anti-liberal governing class, and an anti-virtue, anti-rational intellectual establishment.  As a result, the citizenry has gradually given way to a new entity, "the masses" (once again using the suitable Marxist language), a collectivist majority without any of the reflexes of self-reliance, self-restraint and shame that a virtuous citizenry would have; without any of the respect or capacity for rational deliberation, forethought, and common sense that a properly educated citizenry would have; and without the universalizable notion of freedom -- freedom as an equal, natural right, rather than a childish wish-fulfillment fantasy -- that a citizenry not enmeshed in the mass manipulations of class envy would have.
In simple terms, Western man may, in the main, no longer be capable of living in liberty.  He does not want it.  He does not know it.  And he has been bribed and brainwashed out of the primal feelings that would have made it attractive to him.
In principle, this is nothing so extraordinary.  It was clearly foreseen by thoughtful statesmen of the not so distant past.  This diminished Western man is what Benjamin Franklin was intimating when he described America's new government as "A republic, if you can keep it."  It is what George Washington was foretelling when he warned that the American system of government depends on the maintenance of virtue.  And it is, of course, what Alexis de Tocqueville was predicting when he spoke of the peculiar dangers of "soft despotism." 
These last considerations bring us to a final important point, related to those who see this as the moment for a "second American Revolution," in which constitutional ideals, clearly presented in open intellectual warfare, will win over a majority of the public and lead, in short order, to a revitalized republic, and a reinvigorated modern civilization. 
Defenders of this view remind us that the original American revolutionaries were also a courageous Tea Party minority, forced to fight not only against a more powerful British empire, but also against the acquiescence or complacency of the broader population. 
This is true.  But we must not neglect something else that is also true: the late eighteenth century in the Western world was a time of general rationalism and virtue-based ethics, as opposed to the irrationalism and moral subjectivism of "values," which we have inherited from late nineteenth century European philosophy.  Moral relativism was not the norm; moral debate concerned how best to achieve, manifest, and promote the virtues that were understood as essential to a good life. 
At the junction of ethics and practical politics, liberty was broadly understood in those days as a good; disputes concerned how best to achieve it.  Property was generally understood as a natural product of human life and endeavor, to be violated, if at all, only if one could somehow justify such violation as a rational exception to the rule that men own themselves and their labor.
To state this most simply, in 1776, basically virtuous men fought for the cause of self-determination and limited government against basically virtuous defenders of an established political authority, while many basically virtuous colonists remained uncommitted to either side, thus offering tacit support to the more powerful British.  This does not mean the stakes were small, or the dispute insignificant; but the disagreements were fundamentally intellectual -- the fighting was an extension and outgrowth of an intractable rational argument.
On November 6, 2012, by contrast, a basically virtuous minority fought to preserve the cause of 1776 -- life, liberty and property -- against a basically immoral, merciless mob and its conscienceless, power-hungry puppet masters, while a basically amoral, self-obsessed mass of bloodless, happy-pilled pod people sat on its collective hands and, bored of watching America die, changed the channel to watch American Idol instead.  The war this time is not the final escalation of an intractable intellectual dispute.  Rather, this time the war is between reason and irrationality themselves, virtue and vice themselves.  There is no common spiritual ground to guarantee resolution and reunion after the dust settles. 
Barack Obama and his leftist kin are far less concerned with the justice and legitimacy of their authority than was King George III.  Their policies are far more restrictive and damaging to real individual liberty than were King George's.  England and the colonies were neither ruled nor populated by men oblivious to the basics of moral character or respect for human life beyond their own.  America, like the West in general, is ruled and largely populated by precisely such men today. 
Washington spoke truly: a democratic form of government, republican or otherwise, is only as virtuous as the citizens who form it.  Institutions of liberty, equality, and mutual respect cannot be sustained in, let alone re-imposed upon, a society that has generally forsaken every single virtue named in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, and has in turn filled the soul's moral void with hatred, envy, gluttony, sloth, covetousness, lust, and collectivism's unique license to pillage, namely its presupposition that individual men -- that is, other men -- do not really exist.
The entire moral and intellectual structure of the West has rotted out from within, over the course of generations.  Winning elections is still valuable -- as is choosing the most principled candidates.  (The two are not contradictory goals, contrary to the delusions of the entrenched political establishment.)  But winning elections, even with good candidates, cannot solve the West's existential crisis.  The divide this time is not tempered with a measure of long-developed moral common ground.  Two fundamentally opposed views of life are represented, and the side of reason and decency is by far the outnumbered force.
The modern left's anti-rational, anti-virtuous, anti-individualist superstructure must be destroyed, mercilessly and thoroughly.  It took generations for this brilliant scheme of reassuring repression -- soft despotism -- to be wound around the West, like spider's silk around its paralyzed prey.  It might take generations to unravel it.  The alternative to this fight, however, is to sit passively by as the world enters a new dark age. 
This is going to be hard, and it is going to take much longer than the American Revolutionary War, for reasons I have explained above.  But we can win, and we will win.  Time is not on our side; but truth is.

The great Roman historian Livy informs us that during the times of the Third Punic War, Cato the Elder ended every session of the Roman Senate with the phrase, "Carthago Delenda Est:" Carthage must be destroyed. Having suffered bitterly while battling for the supremacy of the Mediterranean with the North African city state, rumors of Hannibal again amassing an army to confront his mortal enemy stirred the hearts of the Roman people, whose armies had been soundly defeated in battle scant leagues from the city gates. 
The Carthaginians honored their God Baal with human sacrifice, and it is said that Hamilcar Barca baptized his warrior son in the white hot hatred of Rome, sealing the fates of two distinct worlds that would vie on a multiplicity of battlegrounds for the perpetuation of their disparate visions of the world. And though the Carthaginian general's engineering of the Roman catastrophe at Cannae and fifteen years of fighting and winning battles in a hostile environment could have eclipsed the Latin dream of extending its "Pax Romana" throughout the known earth, it would be at Zama that Carthage was thought to be irrevocably broken. But unburied ghosts often return when only attended to with half measures.
It is said that Scipio Africanus Minor, relying upon the good auspices that Hannibal was again seeding his loathing into Rome's enemies through alliances, thought it prudent to invoke martial necessity and erase Carthage from the globe. Livy's Histories tell us that the men who were not slain in battle were sold along with the women and children into slavery as retribution and the spoils of war. Moreover, every structure was razed to the ground, its rubble hauled away and the land itself was sown with salt so that it could be inhabited no more. Rome, therefore, had solved its Mediterranean dilemma and her enemy would never again arise.
In our modernity, the phrase "Carthaginian Peace" is synonymous with any ruthless outcome supported by a treaty that creates a state of total submission in the defeated. The Versailles treaty that resulted from the Great War was thought to be such a one; and yet, the fact that Germany rose again to embroil a world in even greater cataclysm is testament to the hubris of the victors. However, it is not my intent to deal with treaties but in half-measures. In particularly, the half-measures and restraint that Israel has utilized as a stratagem in dealing with the Palestinian Question and in Arab aggression, and how they shall proceed now that things have come undone.
Let us be frank. Oslo is dead. Or to put a finer point on it, Oslo never really was alive. Of the myriad of ceasefires, treaty negotiations and understandings that have been born of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not one of them has ever been countenanced in good faith on the part of the latter. To the Arab collective consciousness, the idea of a lasting peace with the Jew is anathema, and any negotiations, however earnestly lauded in the credulous liberal West, have been couched within that cunning consciousness as a form of diplomatic warfare -- a concerted effort of tactical compression and decompression, expended not towards a state of hostile cessation, but towards the destruction of the "Zionist entity." Stated in fundamental terms, Israel desires peace and those in the ersatz Palestinian state desire an ethnic cleansing of the hated Jew; and no common middle ground exists where the fragile lily of reconciliation might grow. Peace cannot survive in such a brutally inhospitable earth.
For anyone who has honest eyes not blinded with the ideological mendacity of the Left or deluded with the juvenile relativism of moral commensurability in defining these embittered competing adversaries, this is the current unvarnished state of affairs. The "Land for Peace" chimera has been broken irrecoverably with the withdrawal from Gaza, and even the liberal historian and Israeli gadfly Benny Morris has admitted that the Arabs have never been honest in their dealings. When Hamas gained virtual control of Gaza the fate of the region was sealed, since within its own charter there is embedded the unassailable call for the destruction of the Jew. 
In light of this, what is to be done? No sovereign nation can allow itself to suffer silently while its virulent neighbor rains death down upon it. As I write, radical Islamicist elements that have seized control of Egypt, and are toppling Syria, have brought the Golan region back into play, while southern Lebanon is armed to the teeth with twenty to thirty thousand Hezb'allah rockets, to say nothing of the specter of Iran. As Morsi is revealing his true colors by radicalizing the army and allowing the Sinai to become a staging ground for Salafist attacks, Israel can ill afford to play its dangerous game of appeasing the stunningly stupid West, which has become drunk on borrowed wealth and Arab oil. The time for half measures is nearing its culmination. The snake and its brood must be burnt from their haunts. Cathargo delenda est.
A people whose singleminded fanaticism has become pathological has ceased to reason in its own best interests. By using its population as willing accomplices by placing military installations and rocket batteries under and adjacent to mosques, schools, and apartment complexes, such a moral calculus is revelatory of the inner workings of the Palestinian mind. Primarily, it devalues the life of its own people in service to its cause: a cause that would not hesitate in destroying the same enemy domestic targets if given half the chance -- just as it justifies the bombing of buses or the decapitation of infants in their cribs. Similarly, it betrays its own relative ethical barbarism by holding the IDF hostage to its own moral restraints, who are loath to inflict injury and death in their attempts to quell the rockets and mortar teams that hide behind human shields. We cannot lose sight of the reality that the outrage that attends collateral damage inflicted by the IDF and by Hamas is incommensurately perceived in both the Arab and Western world. Such is the handicap that Israel is hobbled with in waging a war of self-preservation.
As the Carthaginians were willing and complicit in sacrificing their children by fire to Baal to achieve their ends, so the Palestinians have so corrupted their children with the enculturation of death that little innocence is left to be found in Gaza, or in any corner of the earth where Islamicists hold sway over men's minds. Israel may soon have to wage a hot belligerent war on multiple fronts with an enemy that is as merciless as any Hannibal or Hitler. That it may have to contemplate what has been up to now the unthinkable is the rotten spawn of the current state of affairs in the world: in the hearts of men who loved ease more than justice, and in the minds of men who loved revenge and blood more than peace or the desire for the safekeeping of their own children, as they knowingly conscript them to the consecrated flames.

While young voters overwhelmingly (60%) supported President Obama in the 2012 election, support for the president among 18- to 29-year-olds dropped 11 percentage points from 2008.  According to Generation Opportunity, the youth defection from the president stems from their differing views on issues - "like unemployment, job creation, taxes and regulation" - and their "disillusionment over the economy and big government."
There was general agreement among the liberal press that fewer young people would vote in 2012, but those "experts" were wrong: Actually, young voter turnout increased from 18% in 2008 to 19% this year (so much for those who said young people were uninterested in the election), but the president's margin of victory with this segment of voters decreased from 34 points to 23 points in 2012.
The data analysis of the youth vote by the Pew Foundation is very revealing.  Support for the president declined nine points among all young men and 11 percentage points among young white men.  Among all young black voters, the decline was four points, but among young black men it was "a whopping 14 points."  The decline among young GOP voters and independent young voters was eight percentage points.
It seems pretty clear that these young people were affected by the unemployment of their peers and the burden that the fiscal crisis will put on their shoulders. The unemployment rate for people 18-29 is at 9.3% (underemployment is at 19.1%), and students are accumulating massive amounts of debt.  Close to 50% of recent college graduates have been unable to find a job requiring a college degree, and it is even harder for youth who don't go to college to find work.  The Sacramento Bee reports that the number of young college grads working as waiters in California almost doubled between 2006 and 2011.  So did the number of retail sales clerks.  Historically, low-level jobs in those sectors have gone to workers without a degree.  That means those high school graduates who typically hold those jobs lose them to applicants with a college degree.
The Young Entrepreneur Council published some startling statistics:

One out of two college grads - about 1.5 million, or about 53.6%, of bachelor's degree holders age 25 or younger ­­- wereunemployed or underemployed in 2011.
For high school grads (age 17-20), the unemployment rate was 31.1% from April 2011-March 2012;underemployment was 54%.
Up to95% of job positions lostoccurred in low-tech, middle-income jobslike bank tellers. Gains in jobs are going to workers at the top or the bottom, not in the middle.
More college graduates are getting low-level jobs, period. U.S. bachelor's degree holders are more likely to wait tables, tend bar, or become food-service helpers than to be employed as engineers, physicists, chemists, or mathematicians combined - 100,000 versus 90,000.
Why, then, did young voters overwhelmingly support President Obama?  The short answer is: Demographics and Dependency.
Nearly 60% of young voters favor an activist government (compared to 44% of older voters).  A sharp generational difference was noted in the racial and ethnic makeup of this year's voters.  Seventy-six percent of voters 30 and older were white, with 12% black, 8% Latino and the rest falling under a number of other self-identifiers.  Among young voters, 58% identified themselves as white, while 42% were either black, Latino or among another minority group.  A popular Amazon discussion declared, "Young voters choose marijuana and government dependency over jobs and prosperity."
An analysis by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University found that very minor shifts among the youth vote would have made a huge difference.  If the youth vote had been split 50-50 in just four states - Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia - Romney would have been elected president.  In each of those four crucial swing states, exit polling shows young voters made up 16-19% of the electorate. 
The Romney campaign had estimated that the youth vote would be about 15-16%; instead, it was 19% (about 23 million voters).  Thus, those extra youth showing up gave Mr. Obama a second term as president.

Never have so many fretted so much about so little.  The Palestinian Authority has gotten the United Nations General Assembly to recognize it as a non-member state.  They have appeared and spoken before the General Assembly many times in the past as observers.
Whatever the Palestinian Authority thinks they are accomplishing by this unilateral maneuver, they are not.  The left wing believes this is a first step to assuring a two-state solution.  It is not.  In fact, it essentially eliminates any possibility of a two-state solution for many decades to come.
Israel now has an excuse to simply ignore Abbas.  He has violated the Oslo accords by acting unilaterally, and there is no longer any justification to pressure Israel to negotiate.  Moreover, Hamas will never accept Abbas's authority over one square inch of "Palestinian" land, just as they will never agree to accept the legitimacy of the State of Israel.  That means, at best, that what the United Nations will be setting in motion is a three-state solution, not a two-state solution.
What the left will learn, much to their chagrin, is that the United Nations has just removed Israel from a very difficult situation.  A two-state solution, whereby Gaza and the West Bank were part of a single nation, was a geographical and security nightmare.  It did not work for Pakistan, which is now Pakistan and Bangladesh.  It had even less chance of working for "Palestine."
Now, with Abbas accepted by the United Nations but not by the duly elected government of the Gaza Strip, a three-state solution is firmly along the way, eliminating the need for Israel to find a way to permit transportation and communications interconnections across their sovereign land.
Under no circumstances will Israel be required to open up Gaza once the United Nations General Assembly recognizes Abbas's government, since his government does not control Gaza.  The distinction between the two lands is now dramatically cemented.  Abbas cannot legitimately claim that an attack on Gaza is an attack on the West Bank, because he clearly is not the leader of Gaza.  Any legitimacy for a united Gaza and the West Bank is now decidedly eliminated.
The absurdity of the United Nations' action is highlighted by numerous unanswered questions.  First, what are the borders of the Palestinian non-member "state"?  There are no determined borders, and there are not likely to be any.  Where would one place the border in Jerusalem?  Will Palestine be asked to forfeit the Dome of the Rock?  Not likely.  Will Israel be required to forfeit the Western Wall?  Not likely.  That means that a military and governmental border will have to be established between the Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock, sitting right on top of it.  How realistic is that?  Good luck setting in place a demilitarized zone on that border.  The most hostile military border in the world would be located right smack in the middle of the holiest sites for three major religions.
For the United Nations to act on this petition without considering these obstacles, and in violation of the Oslo accords, is not just wrong; it is foolish. 
This is a typical left-wing knee-jerk feel good act failing to consider ramifications.  It is emblematic of the disconnect between leftist goals and reality -- a disconnect that has been growing for the last fifty years in Europe and in the United States.  What J Street and other left-wing organizations cheering this absurdity will come to realize is that they have celebrated a path that will increase, not decrease, the chances for a debilitating war that is likely to spread across the world.
We have come to expect no less from the United Nations, frankly.  In its entire history, it has failed to assure peace anywhere.  It failed to establish peace right at the outset of its existence in Korea.  It failed in Yugoslavia.  It failed in Hungary and Poland and Czechoslovakia.  It has failed to protect the millions of lives lost in Darfur, the Congo, and elsewhere in Africa.  Its World Health Organization has failed to cure AIDS or even stem the tide of the disease's growth in Africa.  It has failed to make a dent in poverty, or child labor, or abuse of women anywhere in the world.  It has failed to protect the peace on the Israeli borders at any time, despite millions of dollars spent every year to pay for useless observers.
Only recently, the United Nations promised to secure Lebanon to prevent the rearming of Hezb'allah.  They have proven useless in that effort.  They have failed to prevent any nation from acquiring nuclear capability, the latest failure being Iran.  Their Human Rights Commission has done nothing about true abuses of human rights anywhere in the world, focusing absurdly on Israel, the only nation in the Middle East preserving women's rights and children's rights.  They have been chaired by such "stalwarts" of human rights as the Syrian government.
The United Nations is recognized by many people in the United States as a useless mockery.  Its only positive purpose is to prop up real estate prices in New York City and support the restaurant and hotel business there.  And this latest action will do nothing to change that well-earned view.

Freed of his campaign obligations, Old Nick himself arrived yesterday to kick back with some old friends.  It turns out he is turning his attention back to his magnum opus, The Devil's Dictionary.  It has been almost a century since the first edition was put out, with Ambrose Bierce as his ghost writer.  Bierce's present status, the Dark Angel pointed out, does not permit him to engage in further earthly endeavors, of course. It is time for digital edition anyway.
Over the past 100 years, Mephistopheles has been busy enough sowing confusion in all the languages of the world, but especially English.  "The English tongue went viral right after the first Dictionary went to press," he observed, "largely because I showed it to be so capable of warping the way mortals think."  
I reflected that it truly has become the lingua franca of every tyrant, tinpot despot, and political philosopher since Lenin.  It is hard to see how they could have gained any traction relying on their own languages.  Stalin certainly gave it a good try, but in the end Orwell was able to pen in one English-language novel more deceptive phrases and pernicious usages than Uncle Joe's boys were able to pull off in three decades.  His stable of writers did some amazing things with "liberation" and "democratic," but the Russian language does not have the versatility to invent entire replacements for rational speech,
Consider good old English words like "diversity," for example, or "sustainable." One can clearly see the Devil's work in them.
I mentioned this to Satan, and he replied with a smile.  "Yes, you found me out.  They are the culmination a product line I first tried out during the New Deal, and it really moved when World War II got going.  I called it the Protean Line. They seem like euphemisms, but with a twist: they are not a pleasant way of saying something unpleasant, but rather a pleasant way of saying nothing at all."
The demand for that type of usage is self-evident.  One can get it off the rack and alter it to dress up any pernicious ideology or prejudice. This feat is way above warping words; it is excising the necessity of logic and coherence from vocabulary altogether.
"The Protean Line is a killer app.  Everyone can be for one of these word products - or put another way, no one can say they are against it," Satan observed.  "It does not have an antithesis, so it meets no resistance at all.   'Proactive' is another big mover.  No one had even heard of that before 1938. "
But the Devil acknowledges that parlor tricks from the Protean Line do not fit well into the format of his Dictionary.  It will not do have scores of listings, each followed by the definition "a borrowed word returned without content."  To qualify for The Devil's Dictionary, a word or phrase must carry a specific, deleterious, and hidden meaning.  After all, the very point of the book is to enable one to unmask what a politician, merchant, lawyer, or journalist is really saying. 
Beezlebub then handed me some words he had scribbled down as he sneaked them into the language.  "Give those a gander," he said, "and get back to me with definitions as you understand them.

Iran has made common cause with similarly nasty countries around the world to promote an anti-American, anti-Israel and anti-Western agenda. This includes the transfer of weapons as well as the training of terrorists who return to their places of origin ready and able to blow themselves up. While the U.S. focuses almost exclusively on Iran's acquisition of nuclear capability, its conventional military relations with countries such as Sudan are largely ignored. 
Israel doesn't have the luxury of feigned ignorance.
On 24 October, the Yarmouk arms factory in Khartoum exploded. The specific target appears to have been two buildings housing Iranian Fajr-5 rockets. It wasn't the first time weapons blew up in Sudan; in December 2011, April 2011, March 2009 and January 2009 someone took proactive measures to prevent the movement of arms from Sudan to what appeared to be their destination in the Gaza Strip. Sudan blamed Israel then and blames Israel now. "Israel is a country of injustice that needs to be deterred," Vice President Ali Osman Taha told the crowd while standing next to President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
Taha's words were a pointed choice.
Sudan is itself a "country of injustice." The war in Darfur is estimated to have killed between 170,000 and 460,000 people. The Khartoum government claims "only" 20,000 people died in Darfur, but UN Humanitarian Chief Jan Egeland told AP in 2008, "400,000 is probably closer to the truth." The North-South civil war is estimated to have killed nearly 2 million people and continues today despite a peace treaty and the 2011 independence of South Sudan.
Sudan is currently conducting air strikes targeting the Nuba people of South Kordofan, accusing them of supporting forces across the international border in South Sudan. Former American aid worker Ryan Boyette, who lives in the region, estimates that 300,000 people have been displaced by the air strikes, but says the death toll is unclear because the Nuba Mountain area has few, if any, roads. Such strikes, according to Human Rights Watch, may constitute war crimes.
It is unlikely to matter.
Sudan's President Bashir is already under indictment for genocide and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court; there are two warrants for his arrest. Not one to let it bother him, Bashir has traveled extensively to countries of the African Union, the League of Arab States, and the Non-Aligned Movement, all of which simply decline to recognize the ICC's warrants.
Sudan also harbors Ahmed Haroun and Aly Koushayb. Appointed by Bashir in 2007 to "investigate" "war crimes" in Darfur, Haroun was indicted by the ICC later that year for having armed and trained the murderous Janjaweed militias and having full knowledge of atrocities committed against civilians. Despite the indictment, Haroun served as "Minister for Humanitarian Affairs" until 2009, when he was appointed Governor of South Kordofan (see "air strikes" above). Aly Koushayb -- also known as Ali Abd-Al-Rahman -- is a Janjaweed commander indicted by the ICC. Koushayb was briefly arrested by the Sudanese government, but released for "lack of evidence" and he continues to live freely in Khartoum.
The nature of the regime is important in its own right -- although really, after 40,000 dead in Syria under circumstances including air strikes and cluster bombs, is there any expectation that anyone but Israel will be called to account for civilian casualties? From the perspective of American national interests, however, lack of effective action to remove Bashir and his lieutenants allows Iran to vastly expand its conventional reach and encourage endless warfare in the region.
The U.S. has let the countries of the Arab League, the African Union, and the Non-Aligned Movement off the hook. African Union countries have received assistance from US AFRICOM to help fight Islamic terrorists; the U.S. supports the government of Bahrain as it battles Iranian-supported Shi'ites; we support Yemen against al Qaeda; we support Egypt, Bashir's planned next port of call as he views the Morsi government as an ally of his Islamic Republic.
Has the U.S. made clear -- can the U.S. make clear -- what it expects from those who expect something from us?
The administration said nothing critical of the raid on Khartoum, but it has equally said nothing critical of Sudan. The U.S. is not entirely sidelined, having been known to share intelligence information with Israel regarding Iranian ship movements and other arms-related transfers. The joint activities have been instrumental in stopping many dangerous cargoes from reaching their intended ports -- Iran is, after all, embargoed by the UN from shipping weapons out as well as bringing them in. Iran wasted no time revisiting Khartoum with its warships and unknown cargo.
But knocking off factories or striking the Hamas depots that housed the 100 or so Fajr-5 missiles that Israel missed before they got to the Gaza Strip is the back end of the problem. Finding a way to remand Omar Bashir to the ICC would not only end Sudan's depredations in the region, but it would help make clear the consequences of an alliance with Iran.

Bill Whittle has been making the rounds with the observation that the Republican Party doesn't believe its own message, and this is one of the main reasons we lost the election. The idea is that Republicans make a show of being conservative, but don't demonstrate a true commitment to conservative values or our nation's founding principles. I think he's right. Bill Whittle is a very smart guy.
 
Lately, the Republicans have been doing everything they can to prove him right. The Republican leadership has long been shifting policies and positions to the left, and is now accelerating in that direction. We need a "bigger tent", don't you know, and the best way to get a "bigger tent" is to become more like the Democrats.
 
John McCain says we need to leave abortion alone and get to the business of immigration reform. McCain wants another amnesty. He's learned nothing of the disaster of the last one. Republican officials Saxby Chambliss, Peter King, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker, Eric Cantor, John McCain and others are backing off, or outright reneging, on their Taxpayer Protection Pledge not to raise taxes.
 
Abortion, amnesty and tax-and-spend policies: Does this sound like a party that truly believes in conservative values and America's founding principles?
 
Listen, Republican leadership, you made a cock-up of this last election. We conservatives are stunned and still reeling that you could have lost it. We can't believe it. This election was impossible to lose. We should have been able to run Donald Duck and win. But you managed to lose the election to the worst president in American history -- an anti-American Marxist -- in a horrible economic recession he is largely responsible for, and you still lost the election. That is really an incredible accomplishment. We can't wait to see what you're going to do for us next.
 
Conservative Leaders Wanted
 
The rise of liberalism is the cause of America's decline. We need decisive action in the fight against Obama's socialist agenda. And so far, Republicans, you're not providing it. You're being called the Party of Complete Surrender for good reason. I've come to believe that the Republican Party is incapable of defending our nation against the socialist onslaught. Republicans might slow it down a bit, but we are slouching towards Gomorrah, inexorably headed the way of The Soviet Union, Red China, and Europe.
 
This inability to express a positive conservative vision has been going on with the GOP for a long time. Instead of exciting, visionary, conservative candidates you give us RINOs. In the last two generations, Ronald Reagan was the only truly conservative Republican leader, and he had to break the establishment GOP's back to finally win the party's nomination. 
 
How do you get to be a Republican presidential candidate? Three ways: 1) It's your turn to be president, according to the GOP; 2) You have a fire in the belly for conservative principles and the public falls in love with you; or, 3) You want to be president and have the right family and political connections. Let's look at GOP presidential candidates and their reason for running for office.
 




Republican President or Candidate

Reason for Running for Office


Richard Nixon

It's my turn.


Gerald Ford

Oh, sh*t!


Ronald Reagan

I have a conservative vision and I strongly believe in America's founding principles.


George H.W. Bush

It's my turn.


Bob Dole

It's my turn.


George W. Bush

I wanna be prez.


John McCain

It's my turn.


Mitt Romney

I wanna be prez.
Can you spot the true conservative? With one exception, these candidates don't thrill you with their enthusiasm for conservative values and our nation's founding principles. One truly conservative candidate out of eight is a disaster.
So what do we hear from the GOP lately? The trial balloons we are getting for presidential candidates are Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, both establishment Republicans, both balloon-heads. 
 
Jeb Bush? Are they serious? Yes, they are. Let's face it, both Rubio and Bush are RINOs, and neither of them has a chance of getting elected president. Why? The same reason Ford, Dole, McCain and Romney couldn't get elected -- they're RINOs, and the conservative base won't fully support them.
 
Hype and Chains
 
How do the Republican candidates compete with someone who says, "We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America. "This person offers hope and change. That's what most Americans desperately want -- fundamental change. Sounds good. Washington is broken. Without fundamental change we're toast. This guy offers hope.
 
But the Democratic Party candidate lied about what he was really up to.Americans didn't know that Obama wanted to change American into a socialist nation -- and that we is willing to destroy the country to do it. Most Americans still don't believe it. 
 
Say what you will about Obama, he is someone who believes in his (Marxist) principles and has the audacity to actively pursue them, fight for them -- lie, cheat and steal for them. A leader with that kind of fire and commitment can lead millions of enthusiastic followers straight into the bowels of hell, cheering him every step of the way. He's doing it right now.
 
And what is the Republican Party's answer to this socialist menace that is actively undermining our government and destroying our way of life? There is no answer. Nothing. Nada. The Republicans roll over and play dead. Can't criticize the Democrats or the mainstream media will call us racist, homophobic, sexist, bigots. Instead of fighting this slander, the GOP has decided to transform itself into the socialist-lite party, to get more people into the "bigger tent", don't you know. They want to give away Obamaphones too. Bread and circuses win elections, they think. But what the American people really want is someone they can believe in and follow, someone like Ronald Reagan, an honest-to-God conservative with a clear vision for national restoration.
 
The one characteristic that candidates Reagan and Obama had in common is that they deeply believed in their principles and political beliefs. I can't think of a single living Republican I can say that about.
 
GOP's Zero Interest in National Restoration
 
The GOP has expressed exactly zero interest in restoring the USA as the most prosperous, generous, fair, and religious nation in the history of the world; zero interest in returning to the days of balanced budgets, limited government and the free enterprise system. Have you heard anyone in the GOP talk about this? That's all we want the GOP to do. But the GOP doesn't see the situation the way we do. The GOP desperately wants to continue feeding and slopping at the money and power trough in Washington, and will do anything to protect this privilege, even transform itself into the Democratic-lite party.
 
We have everything we need to restore America to its former greatness. Everything. Except for the political will to make it happen, to take the reins of power away from the socialists, reform our government, and get down to the brass tacks of rebuilding our industrial base, commercial sector, and economic infrastructure, powered by a cheap, clean and abundant energy supply that we already have. We have all the physical resources to get this job done. We can once again become the world's most prosperous lender nation instead of its worst debtor nation. All of this is within our grasp. This is a message people are desperate to hear.
 
A New Horizon
 
Ronald Reagan famously said, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me." That's the way I feel right now. The Republican Party has left me and I have nowhere else to go. Yet.
 
For God's sake, Republicans, if you couldn't win an election against Barack Hussein Obama, the worst president in United States' history, in a severe economic recession, a person whose very eligibility for the job is in question, then what good are you? Who needs you?
 
I'm ready to move on. I can hear the storm of protest and denial coming my way already, 'What do you mean, quit the Republicans? A third party has no chance against the Democratic Party machine. You're throwing away your vote.' This is the default argument, and it and the Republican status quo are no longer acceptable. As Thomas Parnell said, "I'll seek a readier path."
 
If I believed there was a chance in ten of reforming the Republican Party, I'd work hard on the reformation, rebranding and rebirth efforts. But we're talking about the party of Trent Lott, George Bush, John Boehner, Darrell Issa and John McCain. It is the party of faux conservatism and little else. It's time for a change.
 
The Constitution Party, Independence Party, Libertarian Party, the Tea Party, and others, need to join forces and form the conservative splinter faction within the Republican Party. It needs to gain power and influence, attract followers based on a solid platform of conservative values, and oppose compromise efforts by the GOP. And when the time is right, it needs to take over the Republican Party -- or split from it once and for all. The GOP is no longer an option. It is only a slower train to socialist hell.
 
The Republican Party doesn't believe its own message, and this is one of the main reasons we lost the election. Americans need a genuine conservative party, one that believes in our nation's founding principles and is willing to fight for them. This is what most Americans desperately want, Republicans. Believe it or not.

The United States will not reverse its descent into the abyss of financial and societal bankruptcy until the current political and governing establishment is replaced.  That will not happen until the American people, who have been deliberately ill-educated and deceived, experience first-hand the early stages of the turmoil and suffering extant in Europe and elsewhere.
While professing to care for the interests of the average person, the underlying motivation for the vast majority of the governing class or Establishment is first and foremost self-aggrandizement and the acquisition of wealth.  While a few may be motivated by ideology, the preponderance are not.
There are no offices on Connecticut Avenue in Washington D.C. with signs reading "The Republican Establishment" or the "The Democratic Establishment"; rather it is an amalgam of like-minded groups with one common interest: the control of the government purse-strings and the attendant power contained within.
The Republican and Democratic political establishments are made up of the following: 
1) many current and nearly all retired national office holders whose livelihood and narcissistic demands depends upon fealty to Party and access to government largesse;
2) the majority of the media elite, including pundits, editors, writers and television news personalities based in Washington and New York whose proximity to power and access is vital to their continued standard of living;  
3) academia, numerous think-tanks, so-called non-government organizations, and lobbyists who fasten onto those in the administration and Congress for employment, grants, favorable legislation and ego-gratification;  
4) the reliable deep pocket political contributors and political consultants whose future is irrevocably tied to the political machinery of the Party; and
5) the crony capitalists, i.e. leaders of the corporate and financial community as well as unions whose entities are dependent on or subject to government oversight and/or benevolence .
The current iteration of the Democratic establishment was begun during Franklin Roosevelt's 12 years in office as the Party chose to follow the lead of those such as Benito Mussolini in Italy, who promoted government as the source of all salvation and survival.  This philosophy fit in nicely with those whose egos and drive was directed toward the aggregation of power and wealth.
The Republican members of the governing class, with the exception of the presidency of Ronald Reagan and the Republican controlled House of Representatives from 1995 to 1998, have been content since 1946 to merely slow down the big-government policies of the Democrats, while publically decrying their tax and spend policies. However, in truth, many have been comfortable with reaping the financial and ego-gratifying rewards of such indifference.  
Since the1950's this overall scenario has been tolerated and generally ignored as the nation was experiencing overwhelming and seemingly endless prosperity.  The Democrats, with the tacit consent of the Republican establishment, promoted an ever-increasing litany of government programs to ostensibly help the people, under the rubric that the nation could not only afford it but was, in fact, obligated to guarantee a "decent" standard of living for everyone.  Further, in the 1960's the American left, as the Republican establishment turned a blind eye, began to dominate the education agenda. The public's children were no longer taught American history and the importance of individual liberty; instead, the basics of capitalism and wealth creation were demonized.  Additionally, the essential characteristic of a flourishing republic -- a society wedded to honor, decency and integrity -- was demeaned and ridiculed. 
Thus the citizenry has become more willing to not only vote for whoever promises the most financial security, but they are now easily susceptible to unconscionable demagoguery and are increasingly tolerant of dishonesty as well as unethical behavior.   Today, with the advent of welfare, food stamps, near endless unemployment benefits, free health care (Medicaid), and a myriad of other state and federal programs, the Democrats have succeeded in creating a virtually permanent voting bloc. One the Republican Establishment now claims, if they wish to win future elections, they must pander to as part of a new strategy of inclusion.  Yet, by their acquiescence and indifference over the years, they helped create their electoral dilemma.
How have all these promises and deceptions perpetrated on the American people placed the nation's financial future in jeopardy?  Since 1956 the United States has seen a phenomenal growth in its Gross Domestic Product from $3,700 Billion (inflation adjusted) to $16,100 Billion (+335%).  However, government spending at all levels has grown from $978 Billion (inflation adjusted) to $6,400 Billion (+554%) and the nation's debt, $2,250 Billion in 1956 (inflation adjusted) is now $16,300 Billion (+625%).  (source: http://www.usgovernmentspending.com)  
As of today, the nation's true indebtedness (promises that have been made for spending obligations, less all the taxes the Treasury expects to collect) exceeds $222,000 Billion. The indebtedness to Gross Domestic Product ($16,100 Billion) is a staggering 13.8 to 1. The United States is not facing bankruptcy, it is bankrupt.
Yet there is no sense of urgency or desire on the part of the governing class to level with the American people. This nation is living on the residue of the economic growth begun in the 1950's and accelerated in the 1980's. That tidal wave of prosperity has ebbed. The United States has entered into a death spiral of unrestrained spending, excessive taxation, printing near worthless money, and stagnant economic activity.  Rather than be straightforward with the populace, the governing class is content to paper over the problem by the usual shell games of phony long-term spending cuts, more borrowing, and prevarications about the efficacy of raising taxes on "the rich."
The true nature of the GOP establishment's motivation has been exposed by their reaction to the Tea Party movement. This grassroots rebellion was the first manifestation of the awareness by a large portion of the American public of the nation's problems and ultimate consequences. Despite the overwhelming success of the Tea Party working within the Republican Party in the 2010 mid-term elections, nearly all of the Republican elites downplayed their success and fell-in with the mainstream media and the Democrats in their well-worn and gratuitous aspersions against these concerned and patriotic Americans. The Tea Party movement poses a threat to not only the accumulated power of the governing class but their livelihoods, thus the concerted effort to marginalize them by any vile or preposterous means possible.
The United States finds itself in a circumstance once thought unthinkable. An ill-educated and near morally bankrupt society increasingly made up of those dependent on government combined with a governing class whose primary interest is themselves. The nation cannot, therefore, make any meaningful course correction unless and until the people finally understand they have been lied to and conned by the current establishment.  That will, in all likelihood, not occur until America faces imminent collapse and the citizenry turns on those who brought the nation to its knees.

While modern society prides itself on being unbiased, it's no exception to the rule that every age has its fashionable prejudices -- and unfashionable people. Among the latter today are white men, and the closer they are to "dead white male" status, to use a favored leftist descriptive, the greater the disdain in which they're held. 
Thus do we see sneering at "old white men." Earlier this year, Senator Harry Reid -- one well acquainted through experience with old-white-male machinations -- complained of "angry old white men" who bankroll conservative causes. More recently, the old-white-media paper the Guardian published a piece about America's changing demographics titled, in part, "No country for angry old white men...." Ah, yes, it's not just that they're old, white, and men, that Triad of Turpitude. They're "angry," too. So just dismiss them out of hand, with their agenda born of blinding, irrational hatred. It's another example of projection, from the group (leftists) that makes intellect-clouding emotionalism an art. 
If we're to define matters based on group identification, however -- and the left makes clear we will -- there is an irony here. 
You could roughly say that old white men built the whole modern world.
You can precisely say this if you include in the category the budding old white men known as younger white men. Who were all the great inventors, innovators, and philosophers from ancient Greece and Rome up through medieval and modern Europe and the United States? Who forged the West? Who birthed democracy? Who improved upon it, giving us our Constitution and modern republican government? There is a reason why most of the busts and pictures of legendary figures portray old white men.
We might also note that while old white men probably weren't the first to practice slavery, they were the first to eliminate it. The same can be said of human rights: old white men had lots of company trampling them. They were alone in crafting the modern conception of them.
And is America really advancing as old white men's cultural and political weight wanes? During what group's hegemony were our national finances, morality, culture, and economic growth healthiest? Is there a group with a better track record of running successful civilizations? As to this, if only old white men had voted during the last 50 years, we likely wouldn't be facing the fiscal cliff that hangs over us like a sword of Damocles. 
Of course, much demonization of old white men is mere artifice, an effort to sell an inferior product (liberalism) by discrediting its opposition. "Hey, why buy from these white-prune Willy Loman salesmen when you can patronize skilled salespeople? We're young, we're hip, and quick with the lip!" Yet this appeal only works by playing on very real prejudices. Exposition of the anti-white variety has been done to death in the Reality Media. It was epitomized when Susan Sontag said, "The white race is the cancer of human history" and thus proved that some white people certainly are. But far more interesting and less discussed is the other bias relevant here: that against the aged. 
For most of history, old was gold. There is the stereotype of the wise old man, and, historically, societies would be governed by "elders." For example, ancient Sparta had a council of elders, and only men of at least 60 years of age qualified. And, of course, insisting that children respect their elders was once common. 
This now has been turned on its head. One underappreciated reason why John McCain lost the 2008 election is that he appeared old -- an old-looking candidate hasn't won the presidency since the TV era's advent -- whereas Barack Obama seemed young and hip. And while fear that the person may die in office and our eye-candy culture certainly explain this in part, an increasingly significant factor is that many view seniors as they do our Constitution: old and yellowed and not relevant to our time. Just consider how the only consistent stereotype the hit show Seinfeld played upon was that of older people -- and it was wholly unflattering. They were portrayed as doddering, out of touch, dishonest, egotistical, argumentative, and petty, too engrossed in trivial matters to ponder what's truly important (such as, apparently, figuring out how to find someone more attractive to sleep with). 
Of course, as George Soros, Warren Buffet, Noam Chomsky, and many others prove, "Wisdom doesn't always come with age; sometimes age just shows up all by itself." Yet even if the two are joined at the hip, it won't matter among a people who devalue wisdom. Note that the definition of the word -- until dictionary writers lost their wisdom -- was "knowledge of what is true or good." But there is no such thing in a relativistic universe, that realm with favored mantras such as "That's your 'truth'; someone else's may be different" and "Don't impose your values on me!" There can be no objective "good" if there is no God; nothing can be truly "true" if there is no Truth. And what is left when people no longer perceive Truth's existence and thus cannot use it as a yardstick for behavior? There then is just taste, preference, and what do we call the moment's consensus tastes? 
Fashions.
And this is where the elderly cannot compete. People who believe in Truth understand it's timeless; that those who have lived longer will generally have apprehended more of it; and that it doesn't matter if older people aren't "with the times," only whether the times are with the Truth. But the young will always be more with the fashions. And owing to that dislocation from Truth, they will often embrace fashions even when they're fallacies. They won't know they're fallacies, either, as moderns' only perceived standard for judging such things is the fashions themselves. And they won't care what elders have to say about tried and true "wisdom." It would be much like telling them that they should dispense with pizza in favor of their grandparents' 1940s biscuits and gravy. It's all a matter of preference, so why should they subordinate their tastes to those of the past?
This gets at the insidiousness of modern liberalism. The French revolutionaries sought to erase the past by starting history anew with their revolution's first year, 1789; the Khmer Rouge sought to do so with their "Year Zero." But revolutionary change is too obvious; it doesn't gently boil the frog as does modern liberalism's evolutionary change. Progressives don't make any major pronouncements, dear citizen, about the first year of the rest of your life. They simply disconnect each generation from the last -- from the past -- with the message that, hey, ya' gotta be with it, which means being nothing like grandpa. And the "it" is change, not tradition; current tastes, not Truth; fashions and not fact. Just convince the young to ignore the old or dead -- especially if they're white and male -- the people who formulated Western civilization's recipe, and that Occidental delicacy is history. Then you will have started history anew not with an iron fist, but sleight of hand that keeps the frog simmering soundly. 
Roman philosopher and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero once said, "To be ignorant of the past is to be forever a child. For what is the time of a man, except it be interwoven with that memory of ancient things of a superior age?" Demonizing white men old or dead keeps the young and alive disconnected from them and hence from the past. This gives us a civilization of children, just the kind of people a pied piper can lead.

The latest United Nations conference on climate change opened Monday in Doha, the capital of Qatar.  Once again, delegates will be at it predicting warming temperatures, melting ice caps, rising oceans, and a general end-of-the-world scenario.  And once again, the climate change vultures who stand to make a buck -- or billions of bucks -- off U.S. taxpayers will be in attendance, urging global carbon taxes, income redistribution, and the creation of an all-powerful climate bureaucracy.
The problem, for the climate change vultures at least, is that there is less and less evidence of man-made climate change.  This year, as in years past, most of us living in the eastern U.S. are enjoying a rather idyllic autumn, with sunny days and pleasantly seasonal temperatures.  The near-term forecast is for slightly above-average temperatures and moderate rainfall.  It appears that this winter will be little different from most winters past.
Actually, all of 2012 was a pretty benign year.  There was distinctly less tornado activity than in years past.  One hurricane struck the U.S. mainland -- a category one causing little wind damage (though flooding low-lying coastal areas where one would expect flooding).  A serious drought continued in the western U.S., similar to though less extreme than earlier droughts of the 1930s and 1950s.  All in all, a year with no evidence of man-made climate change.
So why are the climate change types meeting in Doha at all, and why is the U.S. sending representatives?  Surely not because they actually believe that human activity is significantly altering the earth's climate.  And not because they think they could change things if it were.  They are meeting because climate change continues to be one of the left's leading avenues for global governance.  Instead of calling it the U.N. Conference on Climate Change, Doha should probably be called the Global Left's Conference on How to Take Over the World.
In reality, since the theory of climate change (or "global warming," as it was called before it became obvious that the earth's climate was not significantly warming) was first popularized in the early 1990s, none of the ill effects prophesied by the inconvenient truthers have come to pass.  Over the past twenty years, there has been no increase in storm damage (when adjusted for increased coastal development), no rising of the seas, no global famine (except that exacerbated by environmentalist "solutions" such as ethanol), and no reduction in arable land masses.  If anything, rising CO2 levels have spurred crop yields and promoted forest growth.
The real danger, now as always in human history, is that natural forces will usher in another Little Ice Age like that experienced between 1350 and 1850.  One of the conditions associated with that difficult period was a lowering of the earth's CO2 levels.  We should be glad that they have risen since.
The Doha conferees seem determined to do everything possible to bring about global cooling -- not that human efforts in this direction will amount to much.  What they are failing to do -- and this might be the legitimate province of a global climate conference -- is anticipate the damage posed by a future shift toward global cooling.  A rapid cooling in the earth's temperatures, with cold, wet, abbreviated growing seasons, would devastate agricultural production.  It would precipitate global famine.  It would force humans to burn more fuel to heat homes and offices, and it would be especially harmful to the poor.  But instead of considering what defenses might be raised against a cooling climate, the climate change delegates are for the most part actually focused on efforts to bring about just such a catastrophe.
The real solution to climate change is to recognize that the earth's climate has always been subject to variations in natural forces including solar activity, volcanic activity, ocean currents, and natural CO­2 variation.  Instead of imposing anti-growth policies that restrict carbon usage, countries need to take full advantage of all forms of energy in order to promote global prosperity.  Prosperity, in fact, is the earth's best defense against future climate variation.  And one of the most important factors in global prosperity is the continued availability of cheap, efficient energy sources.  The use of oil and gas, coal, nuclear, and hydro-power can help protect the earth's population against whatever nature throws at us.
In the end, economic growth is the only defense against the ill effects of the earth's constantly changing climate.  Economic growth makes it possible to prepare for natural disasters, and to rebuild and resupply following them.  The climate conference solution -- carbon taxes to fund a bloated climate change bureaucracy -- benefits no one except corrupt officials and carbon enforcers.
The real damage posed by climate change is the way in which concern over natural climate variation can be twisted to serve as a rationale for the creation of a global carbon police.  This vast new bureaucracy would exist for one reason alone: to fund its own lavish and corrupt lifestyle at the expense of humble taxpayers.
How many bottles of fine wine will be consumed by the climate change conferees at Doha?  How many kilos of caviar will be devoured?  How many "escorts" will be employed to entertain delegates, all at taxpayer expense?  And what plans are being proposed to make these bureaucratic perks permanent?  These are the questions that really need to be posed at Doha.  Better yet, forego meeting altogether, and eliminate the need to ask.

You probably remember the massive booing during the Republican primary debates when Texas Governor Rick Perry dribbled out his dippy response to the question of illegal immigration.  With respect to taxpayer-funded incentives that reward such activity, Perry stated he was actually "proud" to redistribute hundreds of millions of dollars from hardworking legal Texans -- many of them Latinos -- to an endless stream of illegal immigrants and their children for the humanitarian purposes of educating them and keeping them healthy.  His reasoning?  As Governor Perry said, "It's the right thing to do."
As a born and raised Texan, I sympathized with Governor Perry's position, though I can't empathize with it.  The reason for this is simple: such thinking represents a complete reversal of the founding tenets imbedded in our Constitution.  In this regard, Governor Perry, and others like him, would do well to read up on our nation's history, specifically our early congressional debates.
In our national archives are congressional records (4 Annals of Congress, 179, 1794) showing that in 1794, a bill was pushed through Congress appropriating $15,000 in humanitarian relief for French refugees in Baltimore and Philadelphia.  At the time, well-intentioned politicians argued that it was not only right, but morally proper -- that it was their duty as elected representatives to "take care of" these people.  During the debate, James Madison stood in the U.S. House of Representatives and wisely objected to such use of taxpayer funds, saying: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents."  Remember, this was the same James Madison who served as the primary architect of our Constitution.
From a moral standpoint, one could argue that each refugee should also have received a free horse, two hens, and a new pair of boots just to help him get started.  However, from a legal standpoint, it doesn't really matter where you stand morally on the issue; the Constitution is the law of the land, and nowhere in it is there a legal justification for such expenditures, much less the trillions we now spend bankrupting ourselves on considerably more worthless affairs.
The fact is, politicians like Perry, Romney, and even Obama have been around for a very long time, and it's always been the same kind of political fight -- progressives on one side concocting ever more clever ways of expanding authority through vote-grabbing entitlements and conservatives or libertarians on the other fighting to retain smaller and less intrusive governance that empowers citizens through greater individual liberty and protection of unalienable rights.  In the end, elections past and present have always been determined by the success of those who best convey, preferably with passion, their message.
Contrary to popular belief, the big difference in the 2012 election was not that a growing Latino voting base presented a problem for Republicans; rather it was that Republicans failed to properly articulate to that base the conservative solutions and way of life that solve many of the issues they're experiencing.
Now that the election is over and the Republican Party has been condemned as a flop, the prevailing wisdom seems to be, even among some high ranking Republicans in Congress, that conservatives are now supposed to simply prostrate themselves and submit to the will of the winning party.  But if conservatives are to now cater to whatever political whim floats in the breeze, to disregard this or that immigration law for the convenience of the moment, to dump their principles and abandon time-honored precepts that assert the right of each person to his own property and the fruits of his own labor -- and not that of others -- then why have principles or abide by any laws at all...or, for that matter, the Constitution?
This all precisely underscores Laura Ingraham's unapologetic post-election point, one that she has been making since November 7 -- albeit mostly in an isolated effort on the part of the vast majority of conservative radio talk show hosts.  To add to her argument, one might follow with another logical question.  If we are to become -- as President John Adams so ardently warned against -- a nation of men rather than a nation of laws, why even bother with elections?  Obviously, once you concede your will to that which is antithetical to all you believe in, you now stand for everything -- which means, in fact, that you believe in nothing.  And standing for everything and believing in nothing make for no way to win elections, much less maintain a great nation.
We conservatives, along with our constitutional cousins the libertarians, lost the 2012 election because too many of us apathetically withered away in the midst of the political storm, rather than fought back as if our way of life depended on it, which it did!  Now we and our disgruntled friends in the Republican Party are as good as dead on arrival at the next election.  Right?
Wrong!  We win next time by telling our progressive friends -- regardless of party -- to take a hike, then honestly and articulately go after the characteristically conservative, hardworking, pro-life, and pro-religious Latino voters, as well as those ten million-plus "on-the-fence" voters who never showed up at the polls on November 6.
It's time we wake up to reality.  We've been drinking the other guys' Kool-Aid for too long; we need to join forces and get back in the fight!  But how, one might ask, do we win our fight if our message stays the same?  The answer, I believe, lies not in a change of our message, but rather in how artfully and robustly our message is articulated.
The essence of our nation's immigrant character is imbedded in same quintessential American philosophy that has built our country for over two hundred years.  Let us not forget that the immigrant's dream is our dream, the same as it was in the days of our founding.  But let us also not forget that if, for political convenience, we were to just give the dream away via amnesty -- free of the sacrifice, blood, sweat, and tears that have become so honorably entwined in our nation's historic struggle for freedom and prosperity -- then America will be special no longer, and all that it now represents and all that it was meant to be will quickly fade into the dustbin of history.  Who then will be there for the immigrant, legal or illegal?  The dream that once was will be no longer, because America will no longer be.

I greatly admire Mitt Romney, but I think he was too much of a nice guy to win the election. He needed to get into the trenches, get his hands dirty, and have a drink -- although a non-alcoholic one -- with some of the boys. When it comes to the Latino vote, I don't think Hispanics saw him as approachable. To them, he was an aloof rich guy living a life they could only dream about. Of course, the liars and demagogues in the Democratic Party made sure that the uninformed public -- their natural constituency -- never forgot that Romney was not "one of them." And because President Obama is not white, Latinos feel he's more like them than Romney is.
As much as I dislike Obama and all that he stands for, I have to admit that his going out into the community after college and law school instead of going after the big bucks in corporate America solidified his credentials as a "man of the people." The question, of course, is whether he could have made it on Wall Street at all, considering his anti-capitalist and populist proclivities. Or maybe it was more than temperament. Maybe he just isn't smart enough to understand how the capitalist financial system works. How the country works. I don't believe he's a socialist but he is so far left that it doesn't make any difference what you call him.
Here in my home state of Texas, the left can barely contain itself with excitement in the knowledge that Latinos will soon make up the majority of the residents. They thus will fight any real attempt to get a handle on illegal immigration, opposing any type of voter identification or anything of the kind. Yet, I don't know many Hispanics, who are not in academia or members of activists groups here, who think of immigrant rights as the most important of all issues. Meanwhile, the so-called voter rights groups claim they are "non-partisan" but never deviate from the policies of the Democratic Party. The left in Texas is eagerly anticipating that Texas will become not just a swing state but turn a deep blue. If that happens, Texas will be another California -- broke, dysfunctional, and mired in its liberalism. Worst of all, Republican presidents may become an endangered species, which would please the left to no end.
I don't buy the claim that the Latino voting bloc is hopelessly fragmented. It is in some areas, pretty much as the black vote is in major cities. Latinos can be as racist as anybody else. Some really dislike non-Hispanic whites, or Anglos, as Mexican Americans call them. Many still see them as racists, as oppressors, which are images perpetuated by the radical left in the classrooms and in "civil rights" organizations run by the left. Mexican Americans have been told that they are victims of an unjust system and thus deserving of government largesse. Another truth is that many of them suffer from class envy. They don't much like rich people and would like to see them taken down a notch or two. If you happen to be rich don't be too ostentatious about it.
The most radical of Texas Latinos hate the United States -- or at least the way it exists now. They continue to fight the Battle of the Alamo, believing that the confrontation was not about freedom but about outsiders coming here and taking over everything. They, of course, ignore the fact that native Tejanos also fought against Santa Ana's despotic rule.
The Mexican American War is something else the Latino left keeps refighting over and over again. They detest the idea that what was once Mexican territory became part of the United States. These people don't necessarily want Texas returned to Mexico and don't seriously contemplate living there. What they want is to recreate the United States so that it fits the image they have conjured up in their minds. It is a vision that corresponds very much to what Obama envisions for the nation. They want this despite the fact that the country could be hurt in the process.
The majority of Texas Latinos are not radical. They are very patriotic and love their country. But many have not bee taught to understand how the American system works. Too many remain largely uneducated or undereducated. Many families don't have a history or culture of education. School dropout rates are incredibly high in the Mexican American community. They simply don't have the training or the background to do much analysis of the issues. So when Democrats tell them that Republicans don't like Latinos or want to take away their voting rights or Social Security they, of course, believe them.
Too many Latinos just make too many bad choices. They drop out of high school, marry too young, or have babies out of wedlock. They believe, too, that government should provide everything, and so they elect politicians who promise to keep those things coming. For their part, politicians who care more about holding on to power than what is good for the country will fight any attempt to change the system while the ones who want real change will be branded as racist, forcing them to back off. So nothing gets done. It becomes a matter of who the label sticks to. So far the left has done a better job of sticking the titles of racist and anti-immigrant to Republicans and conservatives. I watched Spanish-language news broadcasts during the presidential campaign and heard any legislation or policy that would help control the flow of illegal aliens into this country as "anti-immigrant."
The most optimistic among conservatives believe -- although "hope" is a more realistic term -- that as Mexican Americans, who comprise the largest Latino group in the United States, climb up the social and economic ladder, will become less dependent on the government and thus more conservative. The problem is that as long as the spigot remains open and people keep coming here from across the border, those Latinos who have moved up are quickly replaced by more poor and uneducated immigrants. Most of them come here illegally at first but then become voting citizens. So the cycle remains vicious.
During the presidential campaign a conservative group ran ads locally, highlighting Latinos who had left the Democratic Party and embraced the Republican Party and its values. Most of these folks were small-business owners. Whether this type of outreach will be bear any fruit remains to be seen. Even many successful and educated Latinos will never become Republicans. In Mexican American families being a Democrat is a tradition and a custom. To be anything else is like leaving Catholicism for Protestantism.
As long as Mexican Americans continue in this mindset and Democrats continue to demagogue the issues, Latinos in Texas and elsewhere will remain an underclass for a very long time. They will stay a large and widely undereducated voting bloc that will keep Democrats in power for the foreseeable future. And the country will be the worse off because of it.

Despite his "colossal economic failures" and a national debt "above $16 trillion" Barack Obama was given a second term. It is not because the conservative message was wrong; it is because Obama is a master of marketing his message. Seductive and false advertising as well as outright bribery marked this man's first term and will certainly be the hallmark of his second. 
He mesmerized a misinformed or ill-informed public, convincing them that his promises would result in a piece of the pie for them. Thus, currently, "...more than half the population -- 50 percent plus one -- is dependent upon government benefits. For the past four years, the Obama administration has created a Franco-German welfare state whose sole purpose is to forge a majority political coalition wedded to the Democratic Party." The explosion of food stamps, the bailouts -- all translated into an 'I got mine, not gonna' worry about anybody else' mentality that has ruptured this country into two camps. There are those who pay and there are those who expect the payment without any effort on their part. As David Limbaugh has written in Crimes Against Liberty, "in his monomania for socialism, Obama will brook no challenge" (388). 
Which is why the 1952 piece by Elia Kazan titled "Where I Stand" needs to see the light of day again. Kazan wrote it following his appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) in 1952. It is particularly instructive as we now enter the new world of Obama socialism. 
Kazan notes that 
Communist activities confront the people of this country with an unprecedented and exceptionally tough problem. That is, how to protect ourselves from a dangerous and alien conspiracy and still keep the free, open, healthy way of life that gives us self-respect. 
The facts I have are 16 years out of date, but they supply a small piece of background to the graver picture of communism today. 
I was taken in by the Hard Times version of the communists' recruiting technique. They claimed to have a cure for depressions.... I joined the Party late in the summer of 1934. I got out a year and a half later.
I have no spy stories to tell because I saw no spies. Nor did I understand, at that time, any opposition between American and Russian national interest. It was not even clear to me in 1936 that the American Communist Party was abjectly taking its order from the Kremlin. 
What I learned was the minimum that anyone must learn who puts his head into the noose of Party 'discipline.' The Communists automatically violated the daily practices of democracy to which I was accustomed. They attempted to control thought and suppress personal opinion. They tried to dictate personal conduct. They habitually distorted and disregarded and violated the truth. All this was crudely opposite to their claims of 'democracy' and the 'scientific approach.'
To be a member of the Communist Party is to have a taste of the police state. It is a diluted taste, but it is bitter and unforgettable. 
Why did I not tell this story sooner? I was ...held back by a piece of specious reasoning ...which goes like this. 'You may hate the Communists, but you must not attack them or expose them, because if you do you are attacking the right to hold unpopular opinions and you are joining the people who attack civil liberties.'
I have thought soberly about this. It is, simply, a lie. Secrecy serves the Communists. At the other pole, it serves to silence...voices... [who] have allowed themselves to become associated with or silenced by the Communists.
It also left me with the passionate conviction that we must never let the Communists get away with the pretense that they stand for the very things which they kill in their own countries. 
I am talking about free speech, a free press, the rights of property... and above all, individual rights. I value peace, too, when it is not bought at the price of fundamental decencies.
The original piece by Kazan highlighted his "firsthand experience of dictatorship and thought control [which] left [him] with an abiding hatred of Communist philosophy and methods, and with the conviction that these must be resisted always."
So what does this have to do with Barack Obama? Let's review:
He has been mentored by communist leaders throughout this career.
He consistently uses the Saul Alinksy parameters of controlling the narrative.
Through his many executive orders, he has taken away liberties of the American people.
He shamelessly engages in unconstitutional actions and displays disregard for the rule of American law.
He has indicated his willingness to work with Vladimir Putin of Russia as well as radical Islamists who front for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, and other Islamic militant organizations bent on America's destruction.
Obama has thwarted all attempts to expose Fast and Furious and the Benghazi debacle, thus eliminating all transparency concerning these serious situations.
He has been caught in many prevarications and outright lies.
He is comfortable with destroying capitalism, which he despises, in order to initiate a communist doctrine of spreading the wealth or asset equality. Thus, no American can improve his lot, and the Horatio Alger narrative that boasts of opportunity with hard work is extinguished.
He has capitalized on divisions in the country to redirect attention away from his unilateral and unconstitutional actions.
He has publicly stated that he has no use for the checks and balances so vital in American government.
I happened on this Kazan article while perusing an old textbook (copyright 1954) titled Unified English Composition ed. Gerald D. Sanders et al. Comparing the reading choices with any text currently in use in colleges immediately reveals why our students are so unaware of the kaleidoscope of the American way of life. Besides well known classic pieces by Munro, Thurber, Twain, and Steinbeck, are pieces under the heading "The American Way of Life." They extol American ideals. Under "Suggestions for Study" in a piece by Percy Waxman is a question "List several American qualities which the author finds noteworthy?" This is 180 degrees from the standard tenor of most of the anti-American writing in our multicultural texts so popular in colleges today.
So to those who wonder what we can do to recover our country, I would recommend demanding a return to an even balance of articles and essays that remind students what it means to be an American. If the book publishers won't publish these pieces, I suggest we create a publishing house to counter them. We should meet with school supervisors at the high school level and point out the deficiencies of the texts that are currently being used. We should check out history textbooks and demand to know why communism is not explained; why Stalin's murder of 20 million people is glossed over; why information about countries that espouse communism which has made life unbearable for its inhabitants is ignored.
We need to be better marketers for liberty. We need to call Obama out when he creates a web of deceit. If he can come up with one-liners for his party line, so can we. 
In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel Prize Winner economist Daniel Kahneman discusses "Cognitive Ease" in Chapter 5. He discusses the "experience of familiarity." He writes that "[a] reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact" (62). 
Why then have we not learned these marketing and psychological techniques and applied them properly to our message? Why do we bog down with messages that lose their audience? We need to cultivate young conservative speakers who can engage the vast numbers of young people who need to have their basic instincts better articulated. If we need to be considered credible and intelligent, we cannot continue to "use complex language where simpler language will do." Even more important, we need to make our message more "memorable." Let's get the message into verse; use whatever medium will interest a vast number of young people. Doff the suit and tie until you get them interested. If we cannot engage the audience, it will not matter what the message is.
This is not to dummy down the message; it is to entice a generation of people who have been deprived of the knowledge about what makes America exceptional. It is a rebuilding process that is always longer and harder than the destructive process about which Obama prides himself.
A great deal of money was spent on the campaign. What television, Twitter, Facebook You Tube messages will be made in the next two years? Why don't we repeatedly engage those pop singers who are pro-Republican and get their messages out? If the way to the hearts of this generation is through pop culture, then we need to embrace it. 
At the end of his piece, Kazan wrote that "these things must be fought for wherever they are not fully honored and protected whenever they are threatened." 2014 is a pivotal year to make a difference because the threats still exist.

The marginal tax is the dollar amount or percentage paid on an additional dollar in income. When you speak of increasing the tax rates you are referring to the increase in marginal rates. 
The effective tax is the actual dollar in revenue generated on the total income. This takes into account deductions, credits, and tax-preferred income streams like municipal bonds and capital gains. These deductions and preferred income treatments are the results of policy to encourage taxpayers to pursue these investments not just for their own benefit, but for the larger social benefits derived from such investments. While we treat capital gains and dividend income with a rate lower than the maximum rate on earned income, many countries do not tax capital gains at all. They view capital investment and the economic growth and jobs they create as a worthy outcome of their policy.
The Laffer Curve argues that higher taxes, particularly at the margin, create a disincentive to earn and thus decrease the actual tax dollars generated. This largely depends on the amount of the tax increase and where on the theoretical curve you are. It also depends on which tax you are raising. If you are raising the income tax on a salaried or hourly paid worker, he has few alternatives to paying the tax. If you are raising the rates on capital gains income or dividends the wealthy have enormous flexibility to avoid the taxes. They can favor investments that depend on capital appreciations over a long term, they can place assets in trust, or they can otherwise structure their income to minimize the impact of the law. In a competitive global investment environment they can move their capital to a friendlier location.
The Laffer Curve likewise explains how a decrease in tax rates can actually increase tax revenues. This happened under Calvin Coolidge, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. (Clinton raised income taxes but lowered the rates on capital gains and dividends.)
Marginal tax incentives also apply to other forms of income. For many poor people on government assistance they stand to lose transfer income if they earn a taxable income. The loss in benefits has the same power and influence over behavior as an increase in the marginal tax rates.
If one is receiving $10,000 in various benefits and takes a job making $20,000 and thus stands to lose those benefits, then they are effectively paying a marginal tax of 50%, not including their FICA and other withholding. This is one of the reasons participants get trapped in dependency, and poverty seems to remain in spite of the enormous sums spent to alleviate it.
A more effective way to increase the revenue from the rich without creating disincentives for middle-income earners to increase their effort is to limit deductions. Should a millionaire retain a mortgage deduction on a million dollar house? Should the amount of tax-free income from municipal bonds be unlimited?
The estate tax is particularly attractive to social progressives but it has some very undesirable effects. We all benefit from a long-term investment view, a view that often extends well beyond a single generation. This is true whether you own a working farm or a factory. This creates and preserves capital for economic growth and job creation. The estate tax encourages a very short-term perspective.
If you knew that at the end of every year you would have to pay a tax of 50% on assets you have saved during the year, what would you do? Likely, you would minimize your savings, spending more, and saving and investing less. You would not have to pay a tax on the enjoyment of a better lifestyle.
The wealthy are no different. A high estate tax creates an incentive for conspicuous consumption over investment. While they will use whatever expensive legal tax avoidance schemes are available, we all suffer from the smaller investment pool.
In our pursuit of social justice, taking the silver spoon of the wealthy from the mouths of their children, we deplete the investment pool that creates jobs for the much less fortunate. One can sarcastically dismiss this as "trickle down" economics, but such disdain for this perception does not change the reality of the incentive nor its outcome.
This also applies to other taxes that affect investment income. Perhaps we can increase investment capital while still keeping a progressive system in place. For example, we could exempt the first $50,000 or even $100,000 of investment income for everybody and then tax the rest at the same rate as earned income. This would encourage a wider dispersion of investment capital and reduce dependency on social security at retirement.
The more progressive we make the income taxes, however, the more dependent the government becomes on the wealthy, and the more sensitive government finance becomes to economic downturns and bad fiscal policy. If we want a more progressive tax policy with the wealthy paying a greater share, then we should encourage the proliferation of the wealthy. One way to get more taxes from millionaires is to have more millionaires, the opposite of what is happening now.
A growing population produces more income earners and tax payers. A declining population reduces income growth and taxes paid. Some of this loss may be offset by increased productivity, but there is a limit quickly reached in the amount of revenue collected from a decline in the number of income producers that can be recouped from increasing the tax rates on the surviving earners.
Such policies as increasing immigration and encouraging the growth of child bearing families will increase economic growth and tax revenues over time, assuming of course that the growth is in the population of income and wealth producers and not net consumers of government transfer payments.
There is a very real limit on how much the wealthy will pay. Without controlling government spending and entitlements we will quickly outstrip the ability to support the welfare state no matter how high we raise the rates. And even if higher rates did not reduce the willingness and ability of the taxpayers to generate the revenues needed (an assumption which I do not believe is valid) it would produce less revenue than creating the conditions to stimulate economic growth. These conditions include low and consistent marginal tax rates, a simplified and consistent tax code with fewer deductions which interfere with the efficient allocation of capital, reasonable and consistent regulations, and a sound currency and monetary policy.
Consistency in tax and regulatory policy may be even more important that having the lowest possible rate or the friendliest possible regulations. Fear and uncertainty, fed by record deficits and endless class warfare speeches, can do as much to squelch investment as the laws themselves.
We also dilute the effect of a single tax increase when we look at it in isolation. Behavior is impacted by the sum of all of the taxes levied: state, local, FICA, and Medicare as well as the friction costs of mandates and regulations. A small increase in a number of different taxes can slow economic growth as quickly as fewer larger tax increases.
An effective tax system should be simple and not subject to change every time an elected official steps up to a microphone. The most effective tax system we could devise, however, cannot overcome the economic and social problems of a government that has grown too large and consumes too much of our productive effort.

Okay, we've had the End of the Republic, the degenerate electorate thesis, and the ritual beating of Mitt Romney. I hope everybody has had their catharsis, because it's time to get serious.
It's typical in an election lost by the right for every last factor is poked at, examined, and raked over the coals except for the single most important element, always and forever overlooked: conservatism itself.
I contend that much of the problem with current right-of-center electoral efforts involves conservatism as currently practiced. This has nothing to do with conservative principles, or any public preference for moderation in politics. It has to do with how conservatism is expressed, and can be summed up as conservatism's failure to sell itself.
Romney ran a fine campaign. No one in the current GOP lineup -- certainly not those who opposed him in the primaries -- could have done better. He deserved to win. That he did not win is something that historians in years to come will be scratching their heads over, particularly in light of the inevitable disasters that will follow the reelection of the Chicago Moses. 
Romney was also unable, as anyone else would have been unable, to overcome the drag created by conservatism's failure to examine and correct its longstanding flaws. Even as tunnel-visioned a group as the left has been able to figure out these shortcomings in detail and utilize them in its electoral strategy. We have seen the results in the last two presidential elections. It can only get worse if conservative unwillingness to confront its failings continues.  Electoral possibilities will close further until we once again achieve the status of the Republicans at the height of the New Deal -- a vestige of a once powerful political force, active only as a distant chorus to the main action.
One of the major failings of millennial conservatism -- possibly its major failing -- involves image. There's certainly nothing new about this. Conservatism has always had problems dealing with questions of image, ranging from the days when they had no idea there was such a thing, to the days when image was viewed as a novelty and thus suspect (in much the same way as shirts with attached collars and cars that started without the help of a crank), to today, when... well, to today, because things have not changed in any substantive respect.
Several common stereotypes of conservatism exist and are utilized to define and destroy conservative candidates and movements. These include the twittering, ambiguous urban right-wing intellectual, (Steven Colbert has made quite a tidy fortune caricaturing this group), the backwoods wild man wearing camo and a white hood, a Kalashnikov in one hand and a Bible in the other, the greedy, cold-blooded businessman, and a variant on the backwoods theme distinct enough to form its own category, the crazed evangelical (the left uses the term "fundamentalist", not knowing the difference between evangelicals, Pentecostals, or, for that matter any other type of Christian.)
What all these have in common is that they are clown images -- laughable, easily caricatured, and, like all clowns, sinister and menacing at base. They are neither rigid nor fixed, and possess enough variety so that virtually any GOP or conservative spokesman or candidate can be slotted into a particular stereotype, and often more than one.  None have any positive aspect. All are intended to degrade, dehumanize, and remove the individual in question from serious consideration. Leftists and their captive media utilize these stereotypes to construct a narrative in which the GOP -- and conservatism beyond it -- produces such types as a matter of course, decade after decade and generation after generation, and that little else can be expected of either.
Image manipulation has been a useful tool for the left ever since liberalism turned transcendental as long ago as the New Deal. FDR put a lot of effort into attacking business interests as "malefactors of great wealth," slimy manipulators exploiting a helpless public, secure behind their green dollar-sign vests while the Depression raged outside their well-carpeted offices. In fact, businessmen and bankers of the early 30s were as overwhelmed and terrified as any everyday wage earner.  The suicides of ruined financiers and company owners are far from mere legend. (One of the iconic photos of the Depression depicted a former stockbroker, middle-aged, well-dressed, and with a slight shameful smile on his face, selling apples on a New York street corner. He had gotten tired of fleecing the public, I guess.)
Since that time left-wing image manipulation has continued unabated through the Cold War (when conservatives were pilloried as McCarthyists), the Civil Rights Era (racists, naturally enough), the Reagan era, (the "decade of greed"), and the Bush era, which introduced "neocons", a distortion of a very real faction which no leftist could have accurately defined if hung out a window by his heels.
Under this onslaught, conservatives simply sat there stupefied, like pinstriped versions of those clown dolls that pop back up when hit. The left worked every possible theme from every possible angle through every possible medium, from the printed press through entertainment, though academia and finally though the Net and social media. These efforts have been highly effective, and are one of the primary explanations as to why left-wing progressivism remains a serious force in a society so inhospitable to it.
(Note that the typical left-wing image -- various shades of congenital rebel -- carries little of the ignominy attached to those pinned on the right, and in fact, has considerable innate appeal to the inexperienced, uneducated, and plain foolish.)
These images have become received wisdom among the public at large, beyond debate or necessity of proof. They are fully integrated into public consciousness and have virtually become matters of instinct -- people hear "conservative", "Republican", or "neocon" and immediately picture one stereotype or the other. They govern all discussions of conservatism in this country -- anyone who doubts this has never spoken to a liberal.
You can look long and hard to find any sign of effort by the conservative movement to combat or correct these stereotypes, from the day of their first appearance to the moment that you logged onto this site, and you will find nothing.
The typical leftist method is to create and maintain the stereotype and then slot individuals into the one that they share superficial characteristics with. The individual is then saddled with all kinds of baggage usually having no relevance or connection to his actual status or character. He has to battle his way through all of it simply to reach the starting line. Ten years after Senator Joe McCarthy nearly wrecked the anti-communist movement though a display of pure opportunism (I have long thought that somewhere in the KGB archives, there exists a large file on the successful penetration agent, Iosif Makartov),  presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was hit from all sides with the label of anti-communist extremist.  Goldwater was plainspoken and made a number of remarks that, taken out of context, seemed to validate the charge. (It's seldom pointed out that most of these comments -- on Soviet aggression, the Vietnam war, the welfare state, social decadence, and crime, were borne out in detail by the end of the decade.) Goldwater was beaten by Lyndon B. Johnson in one of the most lopsided landslides in American political history. Within two years Landslide Lyndon couldn't have won a vote to be run over by a bus.
A little over twenty years later in 1986, Ronald Reagan nominated Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Bork was -- and remains -- one of the most perspicacious legal minds in the country.  His record was impeccable, his credentials beyond criticism. So the left, in a campaign that came out of nowhere, simply made their case up. Bork was characterized as what might be called the legal variant of the Northeastern conservative template: a cold , cruel intellect enslaved by dusty legal tomes, quite satisfied to let people suffer so long as all the i's were dotted. Aided by a substantial wave of media hysteria, it worked quite well. In a shameful display of senatorial pusillanimity, Bork went down to defeat. No figure of similar stature has been nominated to the Court in the years since.
With almost clockwork timing, 22 years later Governor Sarah Palin, a reform politician of high reputation, was selected as GOP vice-presidential candidate. This presented some problems to the left, Palin being a woman, a reformer, a maverick politician, and having an attractive family including a recently born child afflicted with Down syndrome. It didn't stop them. Using every possible means, and attacking every conceivable target -- including her family (and not forgetting her disabled son), the left poisoned Palin's image to extent not seen since the Goldwater era.
Palin's life in Alaska, which remains a frontier state, enabled the left to utilize the dangerous backwoods hick motif. The governor's status as a convinced evangelical Christian gave them further ammunition (e.g., an incident in which Palin had welcomed an African pastor by taking part in ritual utilized to protect African believers against witchcraft. What would have been commendable multiculturalism from a leftist was transformed into lurid primitivism by a willing media.)
This campaign reached its climax long after the election ended when a known lunatic, Jared Laughner, shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and several other victims (all of them forgotten today, including a federal judge). Attempts were made to depict Laughner as a right-wing maniac in the classic mold, though it turned out that his sole interest in politics had to do with proper use of grammar, a subject on which he had previously engaged in a public shouting match with Rep. Giffords.
Gov. Palin was dragged into this mess on the grounds that her call to "target" Giffords for electoral defeat had somehow led to the shooting. (It should be recalled that only a short time previously numerous artists and entertainers had been calling for the assassination of George W. Bush with no public outcry whatsoever.)
Palin's case marked the nadir of character assassination by the left and in a saner epoch will be looked back on as a milestone in the deterioration of American progressive politics.
With Mitt Romney, the choice of stereotype was obvious: that of the rapacious cold-blooded businessman derived from Gordon Gekko, J.R. Ewing, and the little man on the Monopoly cards. Romney, a man who tithed, who had once shut down his multimillion-dollar firm to free his entire staff to search for the missing daughter of a company employee, a man who had spent a year overseas as a missionary, was the farthest thing in the world from any such figure. But the caricature, in the absence of any conservative pushback whatsoever, was extremely effective. Most of Romney's vote deficit involved middle-income voters in the $30,000 to $50,000 range, apparently fully convinced by the portrayal of Romney as a corporate looter. (The sad irony here is that it is precisely these voters who have suffered most -- and will suffer further -- under the Obama regime. There are few other cases where the American public has so clearly voted against its own interests.) So effective was it that the left's fallback, Romney as religious crazy -- Mormonism having its doctrinal oddities -- remained unused.
In all these cases the victims went on to disprove the left's contentions in detail. Barry Goldwater served in the Senate for nearly another thirty years, being praised on his retirement by the very media outlets that had attacked him so brutally in 1964. Robert Bork stands as one of the most incisive and penetrating (if often too gloomy) of contemporary social critics. Governor Palin effectively rallies the conservative rank and file and shakes up the left with an occasional tweet or two while (wisely, I think) biding her time. No doubt exists that Mitt Romney will find a means of serving his country as he has done so ably in the past.
A detailed analysis of leftist tactics and techniques in this regard can wait. What is important is the conservative response. Disheartening as it may seem, this has been almost exclusively negative, when it has occurred at all.
The typical conservative reaction to leftwing image manipulation consist of simple paralysis, a deer-in-the-headlights response composed of equal parts fear, confusion, and ineptness. One recent example involves Virginia politician George Allen. Running for the Senate in 2006, Allen drew attention to a Democratic stalker named S.R. Sidarth, at a rally, calling him "macaca", a word of West African origin, evidently derived from the macaque monkey and meaning a silly or trivial person (certainly apropos in this case, since Sidarth wore his hair in a Mohawk and dressed with similar flamboyance). Although the term has no discernible racial content, the Washington Post , followed by the media sphere as a whole, accused Allen of racism -- Sidarth was Hindu and thus, although as Caucasian as Willy McGilly, an honorary "person of color."
Rather than challenge his attackers, respond with "so what?" or produce a Photoshopped picture of a macaque with a Mohawk (as I would have done), Allen panicked and froze like a spotlighted rat. He compounded the offense several weeks later when a reporter confronted him with evidence that he had Jewish ancestry. Rather than give a hearty "Mazel tov!" Allen turned and ran off without a word. Although the onetime favorite in the race, he was soundly beaten, as he deserved to be. (Despite this clear record of spinelessness, the Virginia GOP could apparently find nobody better and ran him once again in 2012. He was again whipped, and his political career should be considered over.)
Such examples could be extended almost infinitely. Neither the GOP nor the conservative establishment lifted a finger to defend Robert Bork in 1986. The Heritage Foundation, long known for its concern with judicial matters, spent the summer promoting a trivial book extolling its "third generation" of activists, none of whom had any further impact. When an even more repellent campaign was executed against Clarence Thomas, he wisely (and against much conservative "advice") acted on his own, swiftly turning the tables against his tormentors.
During the Bush administration, attacks against the president amounting to calls for his assassination (on the grounds that he was a "fascist dictator") were allowed to pass unchallenged. Rhetoric of this type would have horrified the country under previous administrations. Because conservatives chose to hide under rocks, threats of violence have become a standard means of harassment for figures ranging from Lawrence O'Donnell to the SEIU.
The conservative reaction can only be viewed as an expression of cowardice. So the public views it, and they are quite correct. A politician or party that will not stand up for its own reputation is unlikely to stand up for anything at all -- principle, tradition, or the interests of the voters.
But this is far from the lowest class of response. That belongs to the conservative turncoats, a large group among the upper conservative punditry, who are not only easily led into stereotyping their own but can often be found taking the lead. These include Kathleen Parker, David Brooks, David Frum, Peggy Noonan, and Andrew Sullivan. This group reacted with vigor to the appearance of Sarah Palin, not only jumping on the bandwagon of what, at base, was a public assault on a mother and her family,  but taking the reins and  clearing traffic for it. One of them, Andrew Sullivan, a gay man with the squeamishness concerning childbirth and child rearing often displayed by gay men, topped them all with a grotesque conspiracy theory in which the governor's son Trig had actually been borne by her daughter Bristol, thus adding a gamey whiff of backwoods sexuality to the saga.
In 2012, Peggy Noonan, whose stint as a junior speechwriter for Ronald Reagan gave her a vastly inflated reputation for political wisdom, joined in attacks on Mitt Romney after the exposure of his 47% speech. Noonan's comments were, as always, shallow and forgettable. But what mattered was her presence -- the simple fact that a noted "conservative" was chiming in served to validate leftist accusations, in this case of the "heartless businessman" variety. It has become commonplace for the left to haul one of these media right-wingers out when they want to tear down an opposition politician. They never seem to have a problem finding one.
And yet, at the same time, these people are still esteemed by conservatives, still honored, their advice and presence still sought after. This is clear evidence of a serious strain of decadence within the conservative movement.
Which could also be said of the third major class of response, that of embracing the stereotype, of taking it on as a kind of costume, and even pushing it farther than the left themselves. I knew a noted spokesman for one of the major conservative media organizations who used to appear at public lectures with two heavy-set young men standing at either side of the lectern wearing camo fatigues and sunglasses, thus turning himself from conservative spokesman into Benito Mussolini. This same kind of behavior can be found at all levels of the movement from comment threads all the way to the top. Rush indulges in it all too often. Ann Coulter has made a career of it. While definitely a crowd-pleaser, it is, in the end, self-defeating. These stereotypes were constructed by the left for a reason -- to manipulate the public at large, ignorant of political subtleties and unfamiliar with doctrine, into certain visceral reactions to conservatives and their ideas. They were created to destroy conservatives. Why play along with them? 
It's not at all clear why no effort has been put into combating leftist image manipulation and stereotyping. I suspect it has to do with the faux elitist roots of  old guard -- the aping of an imaginary WASP ruling class that one still finds among Northeastern conservatives. Answering, or even giving attention to such insults is considered to be in bad taste and evidence of poor breeding, something beneath the notice of true gentlefolk. We simply don't do that kind of thing, you see.
Well, we'd better resign ourselves to getting our seersucker rumpled and start doing that kind of thing. Inaction may have been excusable fifty years ago, when the major papers, the two newswires, and all three networks were owned and operated by convinced liberals. In the age of the internet and social media, it is excusable no longer. There are vast resources that remain unused in the image wars. We need to learn how to use them.
The value of deterrence cannot be overlooked. Conservatives should select one or more representative leftist icons and Palinize them. Susan Rice, with her decades-long record of incompetence, mendacity, dishonesty, and sleaze (this woman tried to cover up the Rwanda massacres, long before the Benghazi attack), would make an excellent target.
Many old-school conservatives would stand aghast at such a campaign on grounds of brutality and incivility, and they would be as correct as they are irrelevant. There comes a certain point where you must take up the weapons of your opponent if you wish to survive. That point came and went when some clever network exec in the spring of 1964 said, "Let's make Goldwater into a Nazi."  During both world wars, Germany was rightfully condemned by the Western allies for ordering U-boats to sink ships without warning. Then the Allies themselves, out of sheer necessity, adapted the same strategy, utterly destroying the Axis navies and merchant marines with tremendous loss of life. With their action, the Germans opened a door, and had to accept whatever came through. The same is true of the left today.
Punishment is also useful. Every time a leftist media figure employs a degrading stereotype, or insults an innocent party, or suggests that a political figure be assaulted or killed, they need to be punished. The social networks, Twitter and Facebook being the leading examples, comprise perfect weapons for such an effort. Thousands of tweets or emails will send the heads of the network execs spinning, with calls sent out for Larry or Ed or Rachel to drop by the office before they go the studio. Make them pay a price -- now they pay no price whatsoever. All it would take is a little organization.
Another method would be to turn around the stereotypes and begin ridiculing the left on the same level -- not as individuals, but as clowns. This has become known in recent years as Alinskyite ridicule, though it goes back eons before Hammurabi. Calling Sandra Fluke a "slut" merely generated sympathy for her. Turning her into a clown uncertain what to do with a condom if one was handed to her would have shut the whole campaign down in short order. (How about the Facebook "Sandra Fluke Condom Support Group"?)  This kind of thing works, doesn't take much in the way of effort, and we can be sure the left will provide plenty of ammunition.
The same tools can be used to create more friendly stereotypes, to project the image we want to project. In this election Mitt Romney's essential decency and humanity were totally lost. Next to no effort was made to put them across. (Romney himself was forbidden to toot his own horn by his religious convictions.) A few years ago, the National Rifle Association, after decades of fumble-figured PR ("We're only hunters! Honest!"), hit on the "I am the NRA" campaign, featuring attractive NRA members of all sexes, races, and ethnic backgrounds. The campaign worked well, humanizing gun owners and turning back concerted left-wing attempts to characterize the organization as something along the lines of a Jared Laughner fan club.  Similar campaigns featuring conservatives or Republicans is not difficult to envisage.
Such efforts are long overdue. The tools are at hand. We need to learn all there is to know about image generation, narrative strategies, propaganda, and the tricks of the media.
The first difficulty will involve members of our own team. A change of attitude is necessary. We shouldn't expect much from the Northeastern cons -- they're too eager to surrender, and many of them are only nominally conservative at this date.  (They probably feel rather flattered by Colbert's portrayal in any case.)
But the new conservative activists, often dismissed as the Tea Parties, are another story. They are the ones who can remake the conservative image into something that will attract rather than repel. The 2012 election has clearly revealed how high the stakes are. This is a knock-down, drag-out battle, a battle that the movement has so far declined to accept. We must stop refusing to play the game as it has to be played -- refusing to learn, refusing to move into a new era, refusing to step beyond the stereotypes.
Above all, we need to stop walking into sucker punches, playing the game the way the left wants us to play it. The world will never respect anyone who allows that to be done to him. The image of the simpering twit is the first one we need to shed.
Leftist control of the conservative image is no longer acceptable. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Russian socialists split into two warring factions. The smaller one -- nearly miniscule, as a matter of sheer numbers -- adapted the name "Bolsheviks" (the "majority" party) and forced the name "Mensheviks" (Guess?) on the much larger opposing faction. Twenty years later the Bolsheviks controlled Russia, and the Mensheviks were on their way to the Gulag.
Conservatives must seize control of their own image, or risk becoming the Mensheviks of the 21st century.

According to the leaders of the global warming doomsday cult, the average surface temperature of Earth is 14 degrees Celsius (57.2 degrees Fahrenheit), but this is a new value which has quietly replaced the original average of 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit).
In March 1988, a few months before NASA's James Hansen asserted before the Congress that global warming was in progress, the New York Times quoted him as saying that he used 59 degrees Fahrenheit as the average global temperature to calculate the temperature variations.

One of the scientists, Dr. James E. Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, said he used the 30-year period 1950-1980, when the average global temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit, as a base to determine temperature variations.

In July of the same year, a report in the Connecticut-based newspaper The Day was consistent with this claim.  According to the Day's report on Hansen's congressional testimony:

Dr. Hansen informed the lawmakers that the first five months of 1988 were the hottest five-month period on record, averaging four-tenths of a degree above a 30-year (1950-1980) norm of 59 degrees Fahrenheit.

Although Hansen's recent publications provide his version of the differences from the base temperature for various years, he is careful enough not to provide either the observed temperatures or the value of the baseline temperature.  However, Hansen at one time revealed his base value in an academic publication.  That paper, "Climate Impact of Increasing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide," appeared in Science in August 1981 and states:

The mean surface temperature is Ts ~ 288 K.

Two hundred and eighty-eight K, or 288 Kelvin, is the same as 15 degrees Celsius.  A report in the Schenectady-based Daily Gazette indicates that Hansen and his colleague Helene Wilson used this value at least as late as 1992.  Thus, Hansen consistently used 15 degrees Celsius as the baseline average for several years.
James Hansen was not the only person to use this value.  When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was set up soon after Hansen's 1988 testimony before the Congress, came out with its First Assessment Report in 1990, a table on page xxxvii of the report listed the "Observed Surface Temperature" of Earth as 15 degrees Celsius.
Yet another person who used 15 degrees Celsius as the global average temperature was Anthony J. McMichael, an activist professor whose e-mail promising to pull strings in the Australian government figured in the Climategate scandal.  According to McMichael's 1993 book, Planetary Overload: Global Environmental Change and the Health of the Human Species:

Average temperature over past 10,000 years = 15Â°C

As it turned out, the average temperature of 15 degrees Celsius was an inconvenient value that did not support the allegations of global warming.
In 1996, Michael Mann (who shot to fame during the Climategate scandal as the creator of "Mike's Nature trick" to "hide the decline") co-authored a paper titled "Greenhouse Warming and changes in the seasonal cycle of temperature: Model versus observations."  The paper pointed out that the predictions made by climate models were not consistent with observed data and the variability in temperature  likely resulted from natural phenomena.

... the signature of greenhouse warming is scarcely evident in the observational data[.] ... It is possible that observed trends in phase, largely influenced by mid-latitude continental interiors, do not arise from greenhouse warming, but rather from natural variability. Such a notion is reinforced by the fact that marginally-significant trends are found in the control GFDL annual cycle, presumably due to organized century-scale internal variability.
If, on the other hand, the observed variation in the seasonal cycle truly represents a "fingerprint" of greenhouse warming, the GFDL and CCM1 models do not appear capable of capturing the detailed responses of the seasonal cycle to greenhouse forcing.
...
Discrepancies between the observed and model-predicted trends must be resolved before a compelling connection can be drawn between 20th century changes in the behavior of the annual cycle in temperature, and anthropogenic forcing of the climate.

Significantly, Mann used 15 degrees Celsius as the baseline temperature while calculating the parameters of the annual temperature cycle (see Figure 2 in his paper).  Although he could have picked any value in the cycle, he picked 15 degrees Celsius, and it is reasonable to assume that he did so because it was the accepted long-term global average temperature.
Not long after Mann's paper was published, the Worldwatch Institute, an organization based in Washington, D.C., came out with the 1997 edition of Vital Signs, its annual publication.  The publication had a chapter with the title "Global Temperature Down Slightly."
In literature published after the 1997 report by Worldwatch Institute, the leaders of the global warming movement seem to have started using 14 degrees Celsius for the global average temperature.  In 2002, the Sydney Morning Herald quoted James Hansen, who mentioned this new average.

This year the Earth's average temperature was 14.64C, compared with the long-term average of 14C, said James Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who analyses the data collected from thousands of weather stations around the world.

The IPCC too now uses 14 degrees Celsius as its base temperature, as can be seen from a graph that is part of its 2007 document.  (As an aside, it was in 2007 that IPCC won the Nobel Peace Prize.  IPCC certainly deserved a Nobel Prize, but it should have been for literature, as the organization had excelled in writing fantasy.)
More recently, a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office attributes an estimated average surface air temperature of 287 K, or 14 degrees Celsius, to James Hansen and his colleagues.

But Hansen and colleagues have estimated that Earth's actual average surface air temperature between 1951 and 1980 was approximately 287 K (14 degrees Celsius) (Hansen et al. 2010).

It is hard to pinpoint the exact date when the change from 15 degrees to 14 degrees was introduced.  It most likely happened sometime in 1997, and definitely no later than January of 1998.
The 1998 edition of the annual publication of Worldwatch Institute uses 14 degrees Celsius as the global average temperature and provides details of how it was informed of the change from 15 degrees Celsius.  On page 69 of the report, a footnote below the table listing the global average temperatures for several years states:

Base number is 1 degree Celsius lower than in earlier Vital Signs.

On page 174 of the same report, we see the explanation for the change.

In earlier versions of Vital Signs, Worldwatch added the temperature change reported by the Goddard Institute to an estimated global temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, but the institute has since informed Worldwatch that a better base number would be 14 degrees Celsius. James Hansen, Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York, email to author, 18 January 1998.

In other words, James Hansen sent word that 14 is the new 15.

On a sidewalk in Monterrey, Mexico -- a rich (by Mexican standards) industrial city in the northern state of Nuevo Leon -- a kid, reasonably well-dressed with clean clothes and flip-flops, approaches an American and asks, "Por favor, usted me da dinero para la escuela?" (Will you please give me money for school?)
In southern Mexico, a 6 year old -- without any clothes -- approaches an American, "Usted puede darme dinero para comer?" (Can you give me money to eat?)
In the Kabul Green Zone, a clean-cut boy in a new school uniform -- dark blue slacks with a light blue polo shirt -- catches up to some Americans walking between bases. With some shock, one American realizes this is the same boy who, just yesterday, was caked in dirt and wearing tattered clothes while begging for a dollar.
In Manila, kids offer to serve as guides, sell flowers, flag down a taxi for pesos, or just beg. Their poverty runs the gamut from well-dressed, well fed, and clean; to fed and relatively clean-cut kids wearing torn hand-me downs in the squatter areas; to filthy, near feral looking pre-teens without any clothes whatsoever.
One consistency is their view of foreigners -- Americans, Europeans, Japanese, and Koreans -- as wealthy beyond imagination. Foreigners are so wealthy, many are offended -- or even angry -- if the foreigners fail to leave a trail of money.
Why do these children feel foreigners owe them money?
Scrooge McDuck.
Scrooge McDuck is wealthy. Thanks to Disney's distribution, Donald's rich uncle is known the world over. Everybody knows about McDuck's multi-story vault with a diving board, and how he literally "dives in," swimming through his fortune of gold bars, silver coins, and hundred dollar bills.
The money is just sitting there. Never mind Scrooge McDuck earned the money; he isn't using it, so McDuck doesn't need it. In fact, McDuck would still be rich if he gave over half of it away to those who really need it -- like kids in Mexico, the Philippines, and Afghanistan. Obviously, the rich foreigners, like McDuck, are selfish jerks for not sharing their 'luck.'
Reasonable adults can forgive the naivetÃ© of poorly educated kids who don't understand finance. Educated people know Bill Gates, Steven Spielberg, Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Mike Bloomberg don't go swimming through their wealth in a high-rise vault like McDuck. Their money is invested; their wealth is primarily on paper. If the celebrity super-rich ever tried to liquidate their assets, much of the value would evaporate before they could click "sell". Even selling a small percentage of their holdings could cause key stocks to collapse, impact the wider market, and result in real -- not paper -- layoffs.
The challenge is the McDuck view of wealth is not restricted to poor kids in the third world. Aggressive panhandlers in San Francisco have been demonstrating an entitlement mentality for decades. These beggars target anybody who looks like they have a steady job, regardless of whether they are independently wealthy or working poor. The aggressive begging is a soft terrorism -- "give me money and I won't act crazy threatening you" -- justified by the beggar's belief they are owed something by anybody with a job. After all, in the mind of the beggar, the only difference between themselves, the working stiff, and the rich kid sporting a silver spoon is 'luck.'
Far worse, the "rich are McDuck" worldview infected middle class America. A systems engineer earning $100,000/year near Dallas remarked in late November 2008, "...it's time the rich start paying their fair share; poor people need help." For this Dallas engineer, anyone making over $250,000 a year is Scrooge McDuck, swimming through a fortune of hoarded loot. The fact productive Americans transferred over $15 trillion in wealth to the poor since 1964 is irrelevant. He is totally ignorant of real poverty where kids lack basic clothing and can't bathe. The "poor" of Dallas -- like most American poor -- have cars, cable TV, computers, smart phones, and are, more likely than not, overweight.
This engineer doesn't see himself as wealthy. He doesn't realize, an office manager making only $50,000 a year sees the engineer as McDuck. In turn, a person living in public housing likely sees anybody above their station as Scrooge McDuck, sitting on more money than they know what to do with, selfish to the core, winners in life's lottery.
The McDuck view of wealth is static and only sees money as physical. These poorly educated people don't understand money stuffed in a mattress loses value through inflation. They don't understand invested money increases in value, grows jobs, and creates more opportunity for everybody.
For people who believe wealth and opportunity are simply the results of a birth lottery, what is the incentive to work harder? They are zombies, feasting off the productive. For the zombies, people who earn more are not paying their fair share. In the McDuck worldview, to advance, others must be pulled down. This mindset explains why "taxing the rich" is a non-negotiable demand of their leaders, even when history shows increasing tax rates lowers tax revenue, while lowering tax rates historically increases tax revenue.
As Mark Levin says, they are drones.
Listen to Ronald Reagan's 1981 inaugural address where he explains the injustice of the tax system, "Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity." Reagan understood how wealth was created. Instead of dividing citizens along class lines, stoking anger and fomenting envy with talk of "fair shares," Reagan -- throughout the speech -- appealed to all Americans with a vision of increasing prosperity shared by all.
In his farewell address, George Washington spoke at length about the importance of uniting America. Washington also counseled Americans "it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened," and the "general diffusion of knowledge" is "an object of primary importance" because of public opinion's influence on government. When the citizenry learns all they know about finance from Disney cartoons, the Republic is threatened.
Breaking up the class divisions requires debunking the McDuck mythology and educating Americans about wealth, wealth creation, and how wealth creates jobs. Like Reagan, any future leader who hopes to reunite the country, must offer a vision of shared prosperity, instead of shared misery and revenge.

This week the United Nations begins two weeks of climate talks in Doha, Qatar. The primary goal of these meetings is to draw President Obama into accepting a redistribution plan designed extract money from the U.S. economy in the form of a global warming tax and doling out the cash to Third World nations. 
"There will be expectations from countries to hear a new voice from the United States," said Jennifer Morgan, director of the climate and energy program at the World Resources Institute in Washington.
The meeting in Qatar's capital will focus on ramping up what is described as "climate financing for poor nations." American leadership is considered crucial to these plans.
"We need the U.S. to engage even more," said European Union Climate Commissionerâ¨Connie Hedegaard. "Because that can change the dynamic of the talks."
And carrying the water in support of this global scheme are the media, selecting their talking points from a recent World Bank report claiming global temperatures are likely to increase by more than 6 degrees, leading to "extreme heat waves, declining global food stocks, loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, and life-threatening sea level rise."
Given that since 1850 the earth's temperature has only warmed 1.2 degrees (with 88 percent of that warming occurring before 1940), and that the global average temperature has not risen since 1998, a six-degree hike flies in the face scientific sanity.
The lame duck Obama administration will likely be all over this UN plan. As a U.S. senator in 2008, Obama sponsored a bill known as the "Global Poverty Act." The bill would have made levels of U.S. foreign aid spending subservient to the dictates of the United Nations.
Joe Biden, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was a vocal supporter of the legislation which would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid, which amounts to a phenomenal 13-year total of $845 billion over and above what the U.S. already spends.
A release from the Obama Senate office about the bill declared, "In 2000, the U.S. joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015... it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day."
Obama's bill would have required the president "to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to further the United States foreign policy objective of promoting the reduction of global poverty, [and] the elimination of extreme global poverty..."
The primary vehicle for such a redistribution plan would be a tax or fee on businesses that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct of their activities. This could include power plants, refineries, cement manufacturers, and dairy farmers. Those increased costs of production would be passed along to the consumer in the form of higher prices.
A tax on carbon dioxide would also be seen by politicians as a way to offset our severe budget deficit and staggering national debt. It would be sold to the American public in the name of saving the planet.
Obama may be another step closer to realizing his 2008 dream of massive global wealth redistribution.

In the 2012 election, three states voted successfully to broaden the definition of marriage to include two members of the same sex.  In addition to Maine, Maryland, and the state of Washington passing referenda permitting gay marriage, Minnesota repealed by referendum a previous restriction against it.
With the Supreme Court deciding this week whether or not to hear arguments at the federal level on the constitutionality of such unions, arguments for and against same-sex marriage are sure to rear their boisterous heads again.
But while some opponents of "marriage equality" will certainly use the parallel argument of the slippery slope -- which, on principle alone, could potentially further broaden the definition of marriage to legalize polygamy and incest -- few have considered the implications of the reverse side of the argument.
The central question to the argument is whether or not the 14th Amendment's "equal protection" clause prohibits states from defining marriage -- as recognized by the state -- as between one man and one woman, since such a definition would restrict certain persons from pursuing such a contract with the objects of their affection.  More popularly, the question is posed as "Why can't two people who love each other get married if they want to?"
If the Supreme Court rules that the 14th Amendment denies the sovereign states the ability to determine who enters into state-recognized marriages, eventually the same question on the matter of divorce must be raised.
Currently, states are all over the place on conditions of divorce.  While all fifty states (and Washington, D.C.) now have no-fault divorce allowances for two consenting adults, some states still require separation periods before a marriage can be dissolved.  Most states have residency requirements.  Nearly all have some sort of combination of these restrictions.
If the question on same-sex marriage is "Can the states restrict who may and may not enter into matrimony?," and that question is answered in the negative, the question must also eventually be asked: "Can the states place conditions on who may and may not dissolve the contract of marriage?"
On the "marriage benefit" side of the question, what right does the state have in keeping one spouse (same- or opposite-sex) as a legal beneficiary to the other when the other has no such desire keep the one?  Why should Spouse A have authority by default to make medical decisions for Spouse B, even when they are entering a period of separation?
Is there "equal protection of the laws" if Couple A in Washington may marry and divorce in the same month with no preconditions, while Couple B in New Jersey must endure 18 months of separation in order to receive a divorce decree?
The answer, of course, is no.  (That is, if the court determines that the contractual engagements of a partnership -- like, ahem, in a corporation[!] -- are included among the fundaments of life, liberty, and property.)  If the state must accept the contractual agreement between two consenting adults on the contractors' terms, so they must also accept the dissolution of marriage on the contractors' terms.  Of course, this means that states would be prohibited from imposing waiting periods or other preconditions on divorce decrees.  It would not be the state's place to determine whether or not the dissolution of a contract is warranted -- so long as two consenting adults are in agreement.  The state -- both in marriage and divorce -- would no longer be a contractual party; it would simply be the notary.
Some may welcome this as progress: "Who are you to say whether or not two people who don't love each other may live happily divorced?"
But the logical conclusion of such a line of argument is, ultimately, that the state will have absolutely no business in the contract of marriage.
If the terms of modern matrimony (namely, "two consenting adults who love each other") may be defined exclusively by the contractors, the state must be forced to accept that they have no right to encourage or discourage any form of matrimony.  Therefore, the state will have no business providing tax incentives for marriage, as this is not an equal protection of property for those who will not or cannot seek matrimonial contracts.  Medical decisions will be determined by an individual's power of attorney, not by the default of being a legal partner.  Survivor benefits will be determined solely by wills and bequests, not by spousal fidelity.
Of course, if we have conclusively proven that terms of divorce are not the state's business, then it is also not their business to determine "mutual consent."  We must then accept, then, that one party may without delay receive a decree of divorce without the other party's consent.  "I am not happy in this relationship -- who are you to tell me to find cause, or convince my partner, to dissolve the offending contract?"  Perhaps the other spouse may sue for breach of contract, but his or her suit -- just as in business -- could never force one partner to remain.
In other words, a spouse will be legally reduced, in the very least, to nothing more than a "best friend"; at the most, a marriage will still be as capricious as a business partnership.  Person A may treat Person B as a spouse, but it would not be the state's business even to recognize -- much less sanction -- the sentiment of the relationship.  It is the partners' business, and their business alone, if and for how long they decide to perpetuate the relationship.  Marriage will be the handshake of exclusive parties, rather than a union of two into one under the supervision of a higher authority.
In a word, what was once the liberty of pursuing sacred contracts will eventually be nothing more than a licentious pursuit of sensual connections.
If the advocates of broadening the definition of state-sanctioned marriage get their wish, the definition might become so broad as to render the term devoid of a tangible benefit and meaninglessly relative.  That is, except to those who might still consider their vows of marriage to God greater than their obeisance to the state.

Paul Krugman recently praised the 1950s, or at least the high tax rates of the 1950s.
"And the high-tax, strong-union decades after World War II were in fact marked by spectacular, widely shared economic growth: nothing before or since has matched the doubling of median family income between 1947 and 1973."
If we are to employ the post-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc logical fallacy with as much abandon as Krugman does, perhaps what we really need to do is drop a couple of atomic bombs on heavily populated cities overseas.
It's also a bit funny that he used the period of 1947-1973 to evaluate the 1950s. President Kennedy slashed those 1950 tax rates about as soon as he entered the presidency in 1961. So about half of Krugman's "golden years" were after the tax rates of the 1950s were cut.
In the seven decades since World War II, there have been 11 recessions in the US. Three of them started in just the seven years of 1953 to 1960, or exactly the period of our highest tax rates on personal incomes. That is, we suffered 27% of our post-war recessions in the 10% of the time top marginal rates were highest.
The most ironic part of this whole discussion of top tax rates is that they do not even do the one thing they are supposed to do: bring in more revenue.  

  

Data sources: OMB and IRS.
Do you see revenue going up when the top tax rate goes up? You shouldn't, because the correlation coefficient is negative over the 1950-2008 period. The higher the top rate, the less revenue collected. To be fair, the correlation is not statistically significant. That is, the top tax rate has no statistically detectable effect on the amount of revenue collected.
But if we compare the 1950s to later years, there are a few other parameters to examine. The top individual tax rate does not an economy make.
Over the decade of 1950-59, the federal government spent 17.6% of Gross Domestic Product. In President Obama's first term it spent 24.4% of GDP. That is a difference of $926 billion in today's dollars.
Funny, I didn't hear Krugman calling for the federal government to cut spending by nearly a trillion dollars per year. In fact, he argues for the exact opposite.
What did the federal government of the 1950s spend that money on? In the 1950s, the federal government spent 58% of its budget on "national defense." In the last four years: 19%. In the 1950s, the federal government spent 24% of its budget on "human resources." In the last four years: 66%.
Funny, I didn't hear Krugman arguing for tripling the defense budget. Nor did I hear him arguing for cutting "human resources" spending by two-thirds.
Over the 1950s, gross federal debt was cut from 93% of GDP to 59%. In just the last four years, it has increased from 70% to 105% of GDP. In the 1950s we shrank the debt, and now we grow it -- to the highest level since 1947.
Funny, I don't hear Krugman calling for the federal government to cut its debt. In fact, he argues for the exact opposite. He calls debt a "phantom menace."
Here are a few current federal programs and departments that did not exist in the 1950s.
â¢ Medicare.
â¢ Medicaid.
â¢ National Endowment for the Arts.
â¢ National Endowment for the Humanities.
â¢ Dept. of Housing and Urban Development.
â¢ Dept. of Transportation.
â¢ Drug Czar (or any other "czars," for that matter).
â¢ Environmental Protection Agency.
â¢ Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
â¢ Dept. of Education.
â¢ Dept. of Energy.
â¢ Dept. of Veterans Affairs.
â¢ Dept. of Homeland Security.
â¢ Obamacare.
Funny, I didn't hear Krugman's plea to eliminate any of these programs or departments.
From 1950 through 1959, the Federal Register averaged 10,703 pages of regulations. In 2011 it was 82,419 pages. In just the last 90 days, 5,769 new regulations were issued, with 923 more scheduled for the next 90 days.
Funny, I didn't hear Krugman's call for eliminating 90% of federal regulations.
Of all the differences between the 1950s and now, Krugman concentrated on just two: top tax rates and unionization.
â¢ He did not mention that the 50s were the first decade after the 20-year double-whammy of the Great Depression and World War II.
â¢ He did not mention that the entire world was recovering from World War II then, that our infrastructure was essentially unscathed from that war compared to much of the rest of the world, and that the postwar world was hungry for our exports.
â¢ He did not mention that the high-tax years coincided with a significantly higher frequency of recessions.
â¢ He did not mention that the top tax rate has no effect on federal revenues, or that if anything, a higher rate reduces revenue.
â¢ He did not mention how little the federal government spent and regulated in those days compared to now.
â¢ He did not mention the massive federal bureaucracy that grew since the 1950s.
â¢ He did not mention how federal spending priorities flipped upside-down, from 58% on defense then, to 66% on "human resources" now.
â¢ He did not mention that the decade of the 1950s was a perfect counterexample of his favorite tools of economic stimulus: massive government spending and growing the debt.
â¢ As he lamented the decline in the relative amount of corporate tax collected, he neglected to mention that the US has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world.
â¢ As he lamented that the top tax rate is not high enough, he neglected to mention that the US has the most progressive tax structure in the developed world.
Krugman neglected virtually all that was important and cherry-picked the one or two statistics that supported his preconceived notions. In other words, he lived up to the standards of the New York Times.

On January 1, the rates for the federal individual income tax are scheduled to go back to their Clinton-era levels.  According to Tax Foundation, the higher tax rates would bring in an extra $156 billion to the federal treasury in 2013.  But because of the anemic economy, no one wants to see income tax rates go up for the middle class.
President Obama, however, does want the tax rates on the top 2 percent to revert back to what they were under Clinton.  But Speaker Boehner and the Republicans prefer to get more revenue by putting a cap on "loopholes" in the tax code (that is, exemptions, deductions, write-offs, etc.).  In other words, Democrats want to raise statutory tax rates, while Republicans prefer to zero in on effective tax rates -- the "real" rates taxpayers actually pay.
The top statutory rate for individual income taxes under Clinton was 39.6 percent.  But according to the Congressional Budget Office, the highest effective tax rate for the top 1 percent under Clinton was 24.2 percent (Table 1A).  So during the celebrated Clinton era, high earners were lowering their tax bill through loopholes...by at least 38.8 percent!
In his November 14 press conference, Pres. Obama said: "But what I will not do is to have a process that is vague, that says we're going to sort of, kind of, raise revenue through dynamic scoring or closing loopholes that have not been identified." But loopholes wouldn't need to be identified if a cap were put on the dollar amount that can be claimed using them.
Boehner's idea of putting caps on loopholes is a much better idea than merely raising statutory tax rates.  After all, the whole idea of loopholes is to lower one's real rate of taxation.  But here's another idea: rather than caps on loopholes, get rid of loopholes altogether for taxpayers at the very top.
If Congress disallowed any and all loopholes for the top 1 percent, they could set the top 1 percent's statutory rate to their current effective rate and still bring in the same amount of revenue.  In 2010, the effective rate for the top 1 percent was 20.7 percent.  (That figure comes from Average Effective Federal Tax Rates, a table at Tax Policy Center.)
You'll notice that for the top 1 percent, the 2010 effective rate is just 3.5 points lower than the highest effective rate under Clinton, the aforementioned 24.2 percent.  So if the feds simply must raise the tax rates on the evil top 1 percent, they could set them to somewhere between 20.7 and 24.2 -- if they take away all their loopholes.
If one knows the effective rates for all the groups in Obama's top 2 percent, one can apply the above method to them, too.  For instance, the Tax Policy Center's table shows that the top 0.1 percent has an effective tax rate that is a tad lower than the top 1 percent. (Incidentally, according to that table, it takes revenue of just $508,677 to get into the top 1 percent, and $1,973,943 to get into the top 0.1 percent.)
Even if only for Obama's top 2 percent, the radical simplification described above might be difficult for Congress to swallow.  They may prefer to raise statutory rates and leave the complexity in the tax code.  That's because the tax code with its many loopholes is one of the main ways Congress asserts its power.  But consider this: it's possible that a taxpayer could have a statutory tax rate of 100 percent and end up owing nothing if there are enough loopholes.  So it's not too bright to dwell on statutory tax rates when they can be easily subverted.  (Congress would do well to consider the French.)
If radical simplification for the top 1 or 2 percent is a bridge too far for Congress, then Speaker Boehner's idea for capping loopholes should be embraced -- it's a much better way to guarantee increased revenue than a statutory tax rate hike that can easily be gotten around with loopholes.
Speaker Boehner and the GOP House would be foolish to accede to raising statutory tax rates in the way that the Democrats are insisting, because soon after the higher rates are enacted, the Dems will call for limiting loopholes as well.  If Republicans don't play the fiscal cliff correctly, they'll get snookered, and the folks may never get true tax reform.

According to Israel's Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, the first purpose of in launching Pillar of Defense, the country's most recent Gaza campaign, was "to strengthen our deterrence." Now that the operation has concluded, there appears to be little confidence in Israel, at least outside of the Netanyahu government troika that negotiated a cease-fire agreement with Hamas, that Pillar of Defense will deter Hamas from much of anything. And looking on is Iran. If Israel can't deter a thuggish terror outfit like Hamas, how is it going deter its larger and infinitely more dangerous sponsor, Iran? One thing is certain, Israel will never, and has never deterred its enemies by launching operations in which the stated goal is deterrence. 
It is not that Israel's enemies cannot be deterred. Despite the unending enmity and hatred of the three major Muslim Arab states that directly border it (Egypt, Jordan, and Syria) Israel has, since 1948, emerged as a relatively secure and powerful regional state, increased its population ten-fold, and given its population a standard of living that rivals the most prosperous Western states, and absolutely shames those Arab states in practically every meaningful category of economic success, military power, freedom, and just, effective governance. Egypt, its most powerful enemy, concluded a formal peace agreement three decades ago. Jordan followed suit twenty years ago. Syria, which remains implacable, has nonetheless maintained a truce for nearly 40 years. 
But these successes were not won by Israel's pursuit of deterrence. Rather they were the result of four bloody full-scale wars waged between 1948 and 1973. In those conflicts, Israel did not fight to deter its enemies but to defend its borders, seize territory from which the Arabs launched attacks, and destroy Arab armies. 
Arab nations were not deterred from war by any deliberate Israeli policy of deterrence but by traditional wars, waged with traditional objectives. Deterrence was just a salutary side effect of actual repeated military success. 
Beginning in the late 1970s, facing nontraditional, nonstate enemies, Israel began waging wars of deterrence with much less success. In 1978 and again in 1982 Israel went into Lebanon with the stated purposes of driving back PLO terrorists (and Syrian anti-aircraft batteries), deterring further attacks, and securing Israel's northern border, rather than defeating or annihilating its enemies. The result was that even when the Israelis secured military successes (as at the outset of the 1982 campaign) they were unable to translate them into tangible long-term deterrence. Because neither the IDF nor the Israeli public had been prepared for a war of annihilation against the PLO, the Israeli leadership hesitated at critical junctures, allowing the PLO to escape, and turning early military successes into perceived failures. 
Israel persisted in this inconclusive policy against Hezbollah, which replaced the PLO on Israel's northern border. In 1993 (Operation Accountability) and 1995 (Operation Grapes of Wrath) Israel launched standoff air and artillery attacks against Hezbollah without success, but engendering international disapproval when civilian human shields were killed. In 2000, Israel gave up against Hezbollah and pulled out of Lebanon. 
This led to the 2006 War against Hezbollah, which though widely perceived as an Israeli defeat, nonetheless has produced a quiet northern border for the past six years. The Israelis made many mistakes during the 2006 campaign, first among them, approaching it from the outset as an operation to retaliate for a Hezbollah attack and compel the Lebanese government to rein in and control the organization. But a few days into the campaign, when it appeared that Hezbollah was not being deterred and that the Lebanese government was unable or unwilling to act, Israel appeared to change its rhetorical tune, with Israeli officers and ministers speaking of destroying Hezbollah -- a traditional military objective. 
The true objectives of Israel's 2006 operation are unclear and subject to debate even to this day. It's not certain that Israel's leaders ever had a firm idea of what they wanted to do. However, once Israel reoriented the mission, or mission rhetoric, to destroying Hezbollah, or at least its organization in Southern Lebanon (in fact the new operation was dubbed "Change of Direction"), it seems to have had long-term deterrent effect (although this was not necessarily apparent at the time or shortly thereafter). Like Hamas, Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel until the end of the war, but they have not fired any rockets since.
Israel failed to destroy Hezbollah or even most of its infrastructure in South Lebanon, which allowed Hezbollah to declare "victory" in the war. Despite this, Hezbollah was apparently been deterred. Had Israel escalated more, attacked Syrian supply routes, and pressed the attack further, the results would have likely been better. Still, the Lebanese border has remained quiet for six years now, a nearly unprecedented period in Israel's entire history. Hezbollah's loquacious leader Hassan Nasrallah is judged the ultimate intensity of the Israeli response and has since gone to ground, rarely emerging. The war was a defeat for Nasrallah too.
Still, the IDF's overall performance in the 2006 War was disturbing enough that Israel established the Winograd Commission to investigate the reasons for the campaign's shortcomings, and recommend reforms. One of the commission's findings was that "standoff fires," like the air and artillery strikes that solely comprised Pillar of Defense, were an ineffective tactic for stopping or deterring rocket fire. 
When Israel launched Operation Cast Lead four years ago, it combined standoff fires and a ground attack with great success. Indeed, Israel might have easily destroyed Hamas had it pressed its attack for a few more days. Its failure to do so convinced Hamas that Israel lacked the will to destroy it, and Hamas quickly returned to its policy of intermittent rocket fire which finally provoked Pillar of Defense. There is no reason to assume that such a standoff operation, which was castigated by the Winograd Commission, will work to deter Hamas today. Indeed, the reason Hamas launched a dozen missiles right after the "cease-fire" went into effect, was to make just that point. 
The only way to deter a radical Islamist organization like Hamas or Hezbollah is to destroy it -- or at least try. Hamas, Hezbollah, or Iran will not be deterred by military operations whose stated purpose is to deter. They are not deterred by conventional considerations like casualties, damage, or civilian loss. To win, all they must do is launch one more attack. 
A nuclear armed Iran (which seems likely) must be deterred from launching its own attack. Iran will certainly not be deterred if it believes that Israel will hesitate to launch an annihilating attack in return. For Israel, the stakes of letting Hamas fight on another day are greater than whether that organization will be able to launch missiles in the future. It is the message Israeli restraint sends to its most potent enemies. 
Since 2006 Hezbollah has rearmed, and in the interim, the deterrent effect of the 2006 campaign will have eroded. Hezbollah and its patron Iran have certainly closely watched Israel's operation in Gaza, and to the extent they perceive a lack of resolve, will test Israel again. Which is all the more reason why Israel's early termination of Pillar of Defense may well come back to haunt it.

The ongoing and not-so-gradual loss of American Civilization is the result of two related phenomena: the invasion of our country from the southern border, and our elites' culture of self-loathing that oozed out of the noxious slime of the 60's. 
Western Europe is rapidly losing its own civilization for identical reasons (with invaders more poisonous than America's, and its own reproductive decadence, thrown in to expedite the process).
The first phenomenon -- the invasions -- wouldn't be happening in either place had they not been preceded by the second -- our elites' descent into cultural self-hatred.
All self-respecting civilizations defend themselves vigorously from hostile invaders.  
Examples from the West's own past are legion:  
Europe, circa AD 732 (Battle of Tours -- the Franks, in the heart of Europe, halt the onrush of imperialistic Arab Islam); the Spanish Reconquista, circa 800-1492 (the Spanish, aided by other Western Europeans, take back the entirety of Iberia after its 8th century conquest and occupation by Arab Islam); the Crusades (a strengthened Europe emerges from the dark ages to strike back against a four hundred year siege of Europe from east and west -- and theft of  the European Levant -- by imperialist Arab and Turkish Islam); Vienna, 1683 (heroic and successful defense of Vienna by Austrians, Poles and Germans, against invading Turks).
The list could go on.
Other civilizations that thrive today were no less tenacious in self-defense through their history: Hindu India fought valiantly and successfully against Islamic invaders to retain its cultural identity; China -- whose elites today have absolutely no problem with cultural self-respect -- successfully resisted the forces of cultural dissolution during a hundred year occupation by the Mongols; and Japan -- still secure today in its own self-regard -- kept its culture and civilizational identity for a thousand years and shows no sign today of giving it up.  
Only the West -- and, really, only the West's elites -- has become infected with the fatal virus of civilizational self-loathing.
At some point during the 60's -- that wrongly celebrated but actually destructive time -- shallow and over privileged members of my own post-war generation got the idea that our civilization's errors (slavery, the industrial scale brutality of WWI, WWII, the excesses of industrial pollution, our own 19th century colonialist arrogance towards others) meant that we are not merely imperfect (a useful insight), but that we are perfectly bad (the reduction of a useful insight to self-destructive absurdity).
And so America's educational system, gradually echoed by its popular culture, began teaching that falsehood to our children, along with the risible lie that all other cultures, especially stagnant and unproductive ones, are profoundly admirable.
The electoral consequences of those lessons are now hitting us in the face: the clueless under 30's (by 2012, probably the clueless under 35's), unsurprisingly, are voting for the Party whose candidates sound most like their teachers and the movies.
I saw this coming by the early 1980's.
Living in Berkeley helped, where the sickness was more advanced.
The Left, having lost the post 1968 electoral wars that flowed from its 60's excesses ('68, '72, '80, '84, & '88), merely went underground (see Bill Ayers' post Weather Underground career in "education"), burrowing into the key institutions of society.  They were in effective control of the public schools of Berkeley by the 70's.
By the 80's they were surfacing everywhere, in Academia, the public schools, the media and the popular culture. But then there were still other voices.   
I suggested then that we'd better get into the cultural fight at its key choke points, and start body-punching, or the 60's Left would do to those institutions what they'd done to Berkeley.
But nooooo ... all the writers at the little conservative magazines and think tanks said, "We've won, we've won ... see, Reagan's in the White House."
Big mistake.
Politics always follows culture, and we started giving up our culture's principal consciousness-forming institutions in 1975, when the post war 60's crowd was getting its first Ph.d.'s.
And for the last 10-15 years those institutions have been the personal property of the Western-civilization-hating Left. 
Contrary voices, for the most part, have been snuffed out.  Here and in Europe.
Lenin said "Give me the schools for five years, and I will give you a revolution that will endure forever." Or something like that.
If five years will do it, what will be the consequences of having given up the educational system (and the popular culture) for twenty-five years?
Our task is not merely to stop the ongoing physical invasions of America and Europe.  Those unopposed invasions, by groups most of whom who seek fundamental, culturally destructive revolution in both places, are the symptoms, not the causes, of our decay.
We must teach the young, and many others who've forgotten, the remedial truth that they are the luckiest generation in human history -- because they are the inheritors and beneficiaries of 2500 years of accumulated human material and moral improvement, about 95% of which has been the gift to them and to the world of the Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian civilization of the West.
Once this indisputable truth is again widely appreciated in the West, the other critical insight can emerge: that the West has at least as much right as any other culture to preserve itself from the collapse that mass invasion by will cause.  

On the long Thanksgiving weekend, five regular starting NFL quarterbacks of at least partial African descent took the field for their respective teams.  Beyond their obvious talent, all five share a common background, one that is now rare in the African American community and becoming anomalous in American society writ large: each grew up in a Christian home with a mother and a father.  More so than foot speed or even arm strength, this is the variable that elevates them above their peers.
What caused me to pursue this line of inquiry was the fact that I know one of the fathers in question, Ron Freeman, father of Tampa Bay's Josh.  I got to know Ron in 1994 when I did the media for his congressional campaign, and we have remained friends since.  Ron, a former college football star, was running as a conservative Republican in Missouri's heavily Democratic 5th Congressional District.  He won the primary, and although he fell short in the general, he made the best Republican showing in a half-century. 
Ron grew up without a father in a seriously dysfunctional home in Boonville, Missouri.  He attributes his own turn around to the love of his wife Teresa, who is white, and to his faith in Jesus Christ.  Josh, like his siblings, was home schooled in a seriously Christian household.
Robert Griffin III, the Redskins' star rookie, was born in Okinawa to Robert Jr. and Jacqueline, who were then both sergeants in the U.S. Army.  The family finally settled in Copperas Cove, Texas, outside Ft. Hood.  At Baylor, Griffin managed to graduate in three years with a 3.67 GPA and a degree in political science.  During his final year at Baylor, he was studying for a Master's degree in communication.  "I was heavily influenced by my parents to learn discipline," says Griffin, a professing Christian who has been in the church since age seven.  "But my relationship with God was my most important influence."
Seattle rookie Russell Wilson was born in Richmond, Virginia, to the late Harrison Benjamin Wilson III, a lawyer, and Tammy T. Wilson, a legal nurse consultant.  His grandfather, Harrison B. Wilson Jr., was once president of Norfolk State University.   Wilson, who married his long-time sweetheart, takes his Christian faith seriously.  He does not hesitate to mention it in post-game interviews and posts Bible verses regularly on his Twitter Feed.  After Sunday's tough loss to the Dolphins, Wilson posted the following: "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." (James 4:6 NKJV)  Wilson openly declares that his faith in God is the foundation for his life and family.
Carolina's Cam Newton, last season's rookie of the year, is the son of Jackie and Cecil Newton, the latter a Pentecostal bishop who oversees five Georgia churches.  Although both Cam Newton and his father have been involved in minor controversies, no one doubts the father's devotion to his son or his son's to the father. "I love him with all my heart," said Cam of his father.  After winning the national college football championship two years ago, Newton said, "I thank God every single day.  I'm just his instrument and He's using me on a consistent daily basis."
The most surprising member on this list is San Francisco's new starting quarterback, Colin Kaepernick.  Although his parents -- one black, one white -- were not married, his birth mother made a culture-defying decision in 1987: she chose not to have an abortion.  Having watched two newborn sons die of heart defects, Teresa and Rick Kaepernick decided to adopt, and Colin was the baby who came their way.  Colin would grow up in a white household in largely white communities, but color was no more the determining value in his upbringing than it was for Freeman or Griffin or Wilson. 
"We took our kids to church," says Teresa of Colin and her two other living children in attempting to explain their success as adults.  "They were brought up with our values and morals." Colin agrees. "I think it's something where God has really led me to where I'm at today.  He put me in a position to be successful throughout my life."
Although sportscasters have the unfortunate habit of stressing the presumed physical differences between black and white quarterbacks, they tend to overlook the cultural similarities. Jets QB Tim Tebow is not the outlier he is made out to be.  A disproportionate share of quarterbacks, especially elite quarterbacks, share the background of the five just mentioned.
Peyton and Eli Manning grew up in what Peyton calls "a good Christian home." Adds Peyton, "I always felt it was very important to have a good relationship with the Lord.  He always has to be your number one priority."
"I like the saying from St. Francis of Assisi," says Green Bay's Aaron Rogers, "'Preach the gospel at all times, if necessary use words.'" Like the others, Rogers learned his values at home:   "I grew up knowing what a stable relationship was by my parents' example and how it centered on Christ."
"I accepted Jesus Christ into my heart on my 17th birthday," says the Saints Drew Brees, another of the NFL's elite quarterbacks.  "I remember my pastor talking about God 'looking for a few good men.' All of a sudden the light bulb went [on] in my head and I was like, 'Hey, that's me; I can be one of those few good men!'"
The Chargers' two-time pro bowler Philip Rivers grew up in a devout Catholic family, and his father was also his football coach.  Married at nineteen, he and his wife Tiffany now have six children.  His role, as he sees it, is "teaching the kids the faith, having family prayer, going to Mass together and then football."
Even prodigals like the Steelers Ben Roethlisberger and the Eagles Michael Vick, both of whom hurt their careers through atrocious behavior, grew up with fathers and with Christ in their lives.  After yielding to the games' many temptations, Roethlisberger has married and made his way back to Christianity as a regular churchgoer.  One senses that this is more than a PR gesture.
Vick, who did not start this past weekend because of a concussion, likewise seems moved by something deeper than image protection. "I was so self-centered, I forgot about the Lord," Vick admitted of his public fall from grace. "Pre-incarceration it was all about me. When I got to prison, I realized I couldn't do it anymore. The one thing I could rely on was my faith in God."  Helping Vick find his way back was the deeply Christian Tony Dungy, himself an African American and the Indianapolis Colts head coach during their glory years.
Given the impact of faith and family on the NFL, one can imagine how an emphasis on the same could re-shape America.  It is too bad the party in power has a perverse disdain for both.

Twenty-five years ago, Allan Bloom published a book called The Closing of the American Mind, which made a series of stark arguments about what seemed to be happening in higher education.  The left was taking over at elite colleges.  After Bloom's lachrymose lamentation, there seemed to be a boom in conservative alarms about the ideological lopsidedness of the academy.  Some scholars, such as Dinesh D'Souza, David Horowitz, and, to a certain extent, Victor Davis Hanson, rose to national attention on the issue of liberal academic malfeasance.
Since American universities also train and credential K-12 teachers, not to mention journalists and most media professionals, there was a foreseeable death spiral for conservative thought.  Liberalism was destined to attain a frightening monopoly over the culture.
Now that we're 25 years after Bloom, what has been the result?
Conservatives get a big fat F
In part because conservatives focused too much on controversies at elite colleges and then withdrew into well-funded think-tanks, their concerns remained somewhat parochial in dissemination, discussed only in the company of the already wealthy.
Poor and middle-class children born in 1987 are largely unaware that there was ever controversy about what they learned in elementary school, when Clinton was president; in high school, when Bush was president but their teachers hated him; in college, when Barack Obama's supporters taught them ostensible critical thinking, liberal arts, and professional skills; or in graduate or professional school, which they have attended or will continue to attend entirely under Obama's presidency.
In 1998, when I began graduate school, my adviser pulled me aside and said this:

Bobby, I understand that you are religious. But you must never, ever tell a soul about your true beliefs, especially regarding abortion and homosexuality. You will never work in this field if people know what you think.

I followed that advice for ten years, tailoring my dissertation to look progressive and writing for very left-wing journals.  I was quiet about my conservative Christianity until 2008.
One thing that prompted me to come clean with my views, however, was the controversy provoked in 2005 by David Horowitz.  Horowitz sought to use state legislatures to intervene in cases of political bias on college faculties.  The defensive reaction from the professoriate was to say that liberal bias didn't actually exist, that it didn't truly affect the ideology of students, or that bias wasn't that harmful because tactful, prim conservatives could rely on a working meritocracy.
To counter Horowitz, liberal professors began a veritable love affair with "libertarians," whom they often relied upon for statements such as this one, from Sita Slavov:

Writing in "Scaling the Ivory Tower," ... Michael Munger observes that while bias certainly exists, the actual discrimination that results is much less severe than conservatives and libertarians imagine.
Typically, Munger says, "when I ask for evidence of the supposed bias [in publishing articles], the biasee has not one instance of rejection. He didn't write any papers because he had convinced himself that bias would prevent publication anyway." ...
I can personally attest that, despite the liberal bias, I was happy in academe[.]

I only wish my story could be like this guy's.  The moment I hung a small 8.5 x 11 placard saying "McCain-Palin" -- that was all -- inside my office (not on my door) in the fall of 2008, my life became hell.  I've been boycotted by fellow faculty members, been kicked off-campus for events tied to university grants, had a colleague throw flyers at me, been stalked by paranoid professors videotaping me in search of evidence that I'm racist, been forced to turn over work e-mails to left-wing activists on the other side of the country, been sent racist e-mails, been vandalized, been passed over for early promotion despite a very strong file, been kicked off department listservs (twice), been deleted from the department newsletter (multiple times), been bashed on blogs, been accused of inciting anti-Latino racism, been called a gay-basher, been called an "embarrassment" by a senior colleague in an open letter to the dean...I could go on and on.
You can't trust the left on anything
The point is that I took the liberal professoriate's counterpoint to David Horowitz seriously, and I relied in good faith on the academy's commitment to free and open discourse.  When you rely on that commitment, and you are seriously conservative (not merely moderate, or "Republican-leaning," as Sita Slavov says), you get driven out of the field.
I know what it is like to blacklisted -- far worse than what happened to people in the McCarthy era -- and it isn't funny.  It doesn't merely have a "chilling" effect on scholarship.  It turns education into a combination police state and brainwashing camp.
The opposite of blacklisting is also damaging to education: the deep love and respect liberals show to each other based on the flimsiest of accomplishments.  At a dinner with a rare fellow conservative academic, my friend told me, "The hardest thing about being in this field is that we have to fight the human need for love and affirmation."  Rightists get lots of boos and little applause.  It is hard to report to work and not feel envious of the constant awards, blurbs, promos, kudos, endorsements, grants, sabbaticals, acknowledgements, ribbons, and gold stars that leftists give to each other for half-baked, lazy ideas.  Luckily, religious traditions have given us many tips on overcoming envy, one of the deadliest deadly sins.
Don't give up on the kids!
I face 150 of today's products of leftist education every week.  They are the people I teach in southern California.  Despite all you have heard, they are a good-hearted, hard-working generation, but the fact is that they do not know very much when they graduate beyond the overconfident generalizations promoted by people like Corey Robin (who got a book published, complete with lavish praise, claiming all kinds of nonsense about conservatives).
Fifty years ago, when only 7.7% of the adult population received a four-year undergraduate degree, it would have been likely that the students I teach went directly to the work force and skipped college.  Today, however, with most high school graduates enrolling in some level of college classes, and 27.5% of adults attaining a baccalaureate, they receive an education that's been stripped of much of its moral didacticism in order to be inclusive and welcoming.
Unfortunately, the decline in didacticism corresponds with an unraveling family structure.  As American youth are getting fewer moral tips at home, they are also being force-fed loopy open-mindedness at school, which often backfires when they become adults and realize that Jesus's warnings about carnal temptations apply not only to the next world.  Alcoholics, selfish pleasure-seekers, drug addicts, lonely promiscuous people, and partygoers with shallow friends are bound to be fairly unhappy in this world, too.  Hence, a study by UCLA found that half of college students are lacking basic mental wellness and falling into depression and other emotional traps.
Unlike critics such as Walter Williams, Robert J. Samuelson, and Richard Vedder, I do not think that it is wrong for a large segment of the U.S. population to attend educational institutions in their late adolescence and early adulthood.  The gut response to say, "Just don't send them to college" feels like more of the defeatist retrograde attitude that has caused the conservative withdrawal from the true educational battleground over the last few decades.
Embrace your inner regulator
If it were to function correctly, college education would be a rite of passage -- similar, perhaps, to basic combat training in societies with compulsory military service, only much longer.  The fact that even elite colleges such as Yale receive non-profit status makes it fair for the public to intervene in their curricula.  If the left is determined to bewail the lack of regulations imposed on for-profit corporations, then how can they get a pass on the failure to regulate corporations that claim gaping tax loopholes due to a non-profit status?  Colleges are corporations, let us not forget.
When I went to basic combat training in my late thirties, I had a Ph.D. -- but rather than spoil me, the drill sergeants came down hard on me to show that I was nobody special.  Such humility does a citizen good.
The leftism at the core of today's educational system has failed disastrously to do the one thing that leftism claimed as its raison d'Ãªtre: equalize opportunities.  Consider that yearly fees topped $50,000 at 151 colleges and universities this year.  The most expensive list is also a who's-who of the American left, particularly its well-heeled wings.  My students at CSU Northridge paid one tenth of that for one year in 2010-2011.
The difference between the opportunities for graduates from Sarah Lawrence, NYU, Harvey Mudd, Columbia, Wesleyan, and Obama's own University of Chicago -- all now among the top-ten most expensive colleges in the U.S. -- and what my students get is enormous.  The college with the highest-paid graduates, according to CNN Money, is Princeton, home of Paul Krugman, who had this to say:

I believe in a relatively equal society, supported by institutions that limit extremes of wealth and poverty. I believe in democracy, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That makes me a liberal, and I'm proud of it.

As well as this:

The rich are different from you and me: they have more influence.

If you feel that something is not right about Krugman sitting at the most privileged college in America saying such things, your feeling is correct.  Besides the blatant hypocrisy in his words, there is also a long-forgotten passage of the Constitution that applies here.
Since conservatives love the Constitution so much...
The framers of the United States Constitution worried about the creeping danger of a new aristocracy to replace the monarchy they had overthrown in the Revolutionary War.  Hence, Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution posts this stipulation limiting the powers of the federal government:

No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. 

Unlike a law or medical degree, an undergraduate degree is a title issued to someone without a specific skill.  It is a title, but of what?  (As a Yalie, I get the right to say this.)  The differential benefits claimed by Ivy League graduates are gateways to prestige and more money-making, but Ivy League undergraduates are not demonstrably better at anything than other people.  These Ivy wunderkinder on Wall Street did, in fact, lead our country into the "greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression."
It is easier to win the upper hand when your opponents have betrayed themselves, as has the American left where education is concerned.  The United States government is entangled in the whole left-wing aristocratic game, because these colleges receive tax breaks, federal grant money, and student loan guarantees.  If there is any present-day trend illustrating the fears of the framers in inserting Article I, Section 9 into the Constitution, our system of higher education serves as Exhibit A.  Groundless titles of nobility are harmful to democracy.
Right now, the left has its hands dirtiest because leftists run almost all of college education.  (For instance, as reported in Inside Higher Education, only 4 percent of public doctoral institution presidents support Republicans, and not a single private doctoral university president sides currently with Republican policy.)  The good thing about this horrendous situation is that conservatives, if they are smart about their rhetoric, can isolate and identify higher education problems as leftist problems, since there are so few conservatives involved in the colleges that are most blatantly violating Section I of the U.S. Constitution.

After the election, conservatives are still full of foreboding -- and also a pessimistic hope.  Want to know how to spell "default"? asks Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.  It goes like this: "entitlement reform." 
Or this from Randall DeSoto: it takes about ten years for Americans to get it together and form a political movement for change.  As in1765 to 1776, 1850 to 1860, and so on.
I was taking a similar line back in June, trolling James Piereson's take in The New Criterion on the fourth American revolution.  Only I prefer a stronger brew, the kind of thing argued by William G. McLoughlin in Revivals, Awakenings, and Reform.  McLoughlin argues that the great reforms in North American history have always been preceded by a religious Awakening.  Liberal economist Robert William Fogel was so impressed that he wrote The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism to warn liberals of the coming threat to their power.
But now liberals think the weather is set fair, what with the black and the Hispanic vote, ObamaCare, and beneficial financial and environmental regulations about to transform America.  It was all laid out in The Emerging Democratic Majority by John B. Judis and Ruy Teixeira, and they were just confirming what the Clintons were doing with the Motor Voter Act in 1993.
Don't look now, liberals, but this is probably the beginning of the end of the Liberal Hour.  We will know this for sure if and when a great new moral movement arises in America.
What was going on just before the American Revolution?  It was the massive Great Awakening led by the Wesley brothers and Jonathan Edwards.  What did it all mean?  One revivalist preacher commented that it was like waking people up from "the sleep of ages" to the idea that they could be "responsible beings" called to a "life of purpose" by a God that would never forsake them.
What was going on before the Civil War?  It was the Second Great Awakening, led by preachers like Lyman Beecher and Timothy Dwight.  And of course there was Joseph Smith, raised in the "burned-over district" of upstate New York.  Hey, liberals, is America ready for a Mormon president?
In our time, we conservatives would have to admit that the sixties saw the last great moral movement, with civil rights, the sexual revolution, the Summer of Love, and environmentalism.
But now the idealism of the sixties has corroded into a corrupt ruling class of educated liberals hanging on to the shreds of its moral authority by cynically manipulating blacks and Hispanics with naked appeals to race and government loot -- promises that can't be kept, debt that won't be repaid.  The nation staggers from its unaffordable entitlements, its unpayable government pensions, its limping economy, its crypto-inflation, and its regulatory and environmental fascism.
But somehow I don't think that the next moral movement will be about all that.  I suspect that it will be more direct and personal, about the way that the sexual revolution and the welfare state have marginalized the lives of ordinary people, and women in particular.  Scratch a woman, I believe, and you will find an instinctive faith in marriage, children, and modesty.  Our liberal ruling class has taught women to value instead sexual liberation, careers, and childlessness, but these are the values of privileged upper-crust women, not ordinary women.  Sooner or later, I predict, women will turn away from their top-down re-educators, just like ordinary people did in the Great Awakenings. 
We conservatives are already in touch with the woman-led pro-life subculture that is revolting against a Planned Parenthood world.  Suppose that that subculture went viral and started to reach the tattooed single mother working part-time as a hairdresser?  Suppose that some moral leader emerged who could speak to these women and awaken them from the sleep of ages to the astonishing idea that instead of being depressive welfare-state dependents, they could be responsible beings called to a life of purpose by a God that would never forsake them?
Of course, if I can think it, someone is already doing it.  Here in Seattle we have Mars Hill Church reaching out to the tattooed set.  Could it turn into something really big?
Whatever happens, it won't be nice and tidy.  Liberals, of course, will try to stigmatize any non-liberal movement as a nest of racists, sexists, extremists, and homophobes; it's what they do.  But any movement worthy of the name will power through all that.  It will upset the apple cart -- not just of ruling-class liberals, but also of middle-class conservatives. 
Moral movements are like that.  Just ask the folks in the Middle East.

Four years ago, watching the coverage of Operation Cast Lead from the comfort of my dorm, I was a conflicted college student. As supportive as I was of Israel, I still found it painful any time I heard about civilian casualties in Gaza. What I saw portrayed in the media didn't add up: on the one hand I knew that the IDF was engaged in careful efforts to prevent civilian casualties, despite Hamas's strategy of fighting from amongst its own civilian population. Yet the media made it seem like the IDF was actively targeting civilians.
Back then, I understood Israel's efforts at protecting civilians as a something akin to a talking point -- I had no personal involvement in the conflict. Yet I had no idea how true it is until I myself participated in last week's Operation "Pillar of Defense" as an officer in the IDF.
When I moved to Israel and enlisted, I joined a unit called the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which is devoted to civilian and humanitarian issues. 
As an International Liaison Officer in the Gaza office, my job primarily entails coordinating transfers of goods, aid, and delegations into Gaza. I work closely with representatives of the international community, and although our perspectives may differ, we maintain relationships of mutual respect born of a common goal; I am here to help them succeed in their work improving the quality of life in Gaza.
While the day-to-day work is challenging in Gaza, I learned over the past ten days that the true test comes with crisis. At exactly the point where most militaries would use the heat of war to throw out the rulebook, we worked harder than ever to provide assistance wherever and whenever possible. 
The eight days of Operation "Pillar of Defense" have been some of the hardest I have ever known physically and emotionally. The college student from Arizona would never have thought it possible to work 20 hours a day, fueled only by adrenaline and longing for just an hour of sleep on a shelter floor -- wearing the same filthy uniform because changing, much less showering, wouldn't allow me to get to a shelter in time when the next rocket barrage hit. And no, wearing the green uniform does not mean that you aren't afraid when the sirens sound.
Had you told me four years ago that there were IDF officers who stayed up all night under a hail of rockets, brainstorming ways to import medical supplies and food to the people of Gaza, I am not sure I would have believed you. But I can tell you it is true because I did it every night. 
What amazed me the most was the singular sense of purpose that drove everyone from the base commander to the lowest ranking soldier. We were all focused completely on our mission: to help our forces accomplish their goals without causing unnecessary harm to civilian lives or infrastructure. 
It is harder to explain the emotional roller-coaster -- how proud and relieved I felt every time a truck I coordinated entered Gaza, and how enraging it was when we had to shut down the crossing into Gaza after Hamas repeatedly targeted it. Or how invigorating it was help evacuate two injured Palestinians from the border area, only to be informed minutes later that a terrorist had detonated a bomb on a bus near my apartment in Tel Aviv.
So after all that I see and do, nothing frustrates me more than the numbers game that is played in the media. The world talks about "disproportionate" numbers of casualties as the measure of what is right and wrong -- as if not enough Israelis were killed by Hamas for the IDF to have the right to protect its own civilians from endless rocket attacks.
In my position, I see the surgical airstrikes, and spend many hours with the UN, ICRC, and NGO officers reviewing maps to help identify, and avoid, striking civilian sites. One of our pilots who saw a rocket aimed at Israel aborted his mission when he saw children nearby -- putting his own civilians at risk to save Gazans. At the end of the day, what these "disproportionate numbers" show is how we in Israel protect our children with elaborate shelters and missile defense systems, whereas the terror groups in Gaza hide behind theirs, using them as human shields in order to win a cynical media war.
What's really behind the headlines and that picture on the front page? Every day, I coordinate goods with a young Gazan woman who works for an international aid organization. Last month we forged a bond when we had to run for cover together when Hamas targeted Kerem Shalom Crossing -- attacking the very aid provided to its own people. During the eight days of Operation "Pillar of Defense", not one passed without a phone call, just to check in. "Are you ok?" I would ask. "I heard they fired at your base. Please stay safe", she would reply. And every night I made her promise to call me if she needed anything. These are the things that the media fails to show the world, just as they underplay how Hamas deliberately endangers civilians on both sides of the border -- by firing indiscriminately at Israel from Gaza neighborhoods.
Maybe stories such as these make for less exciting headlines, but if they received more attention there would perhaps be more moral clarity, and thus more peace in the Middle East.

The hope that many of us had that the nightmare of the Obama presidency would end faded into the night on November 6th. In reality though, "hope" was not very much of a plan.
In the experiences that I have had assisting companies and organizations avoid bankruptcy, there is a very predictable pattern that organizations face when they are dealing with serious financial problems.
The pattern involves economic growth and prosperity followed by overspending. From overspending and excess comes a period of denial that anything must change to solve the problem. From denial comes failure. If the failure is accepted and dealt with growth is restored and the cycle begins again. If failure is not accepted, the organization will cease to exist.
The sheer disappointment and almost melancholy reactions to the Obama reelection made me realize that the American people are no different in their reactions than the employees and managers of the companies that I am attempting to save.
In any plan to resurrect an economy, as Mitt Romney proposed in his five point plan, a majority of people must first come to grips with the reality of the difficulties that they face. While the difficulties may have been obvious to those of us who describe ourselves as fiscal conservatives, the election results convinced me that the American people have not yet reached that same conclusion.
Typically in most bankruptcies, there is a catastrophic event which convinces the vast majority of people that they are really in trouble financially. We apparently are not at that stage yet in the United States.
Equally as problematic for a financial rescue of our economy was that 13 million fewer people voted in 2012 compared to 2008.
The significance of that apparent apathy is that apathy typically precedes a collapse in an economy. Apathy can actually accelerate financial problems because problems are ignored until collapse occurs. In financial turnarounds, the apathy is the "calm before the storm"
The transition from apathy to a cataclysmic event occurs because the disaster is "allowed" to occur thanks to the fact that so many people are apathetic. Problems quite simply are not dealt with.
In the United States, the analogy would be a transition from engagement of our people searching for hope in the 2008 election of Obama to the apathy in the 2012 election.
The false sense of security that all will be well or that things are not as bad as they expected them to be was prevalent in 2012. The preponderance of support Obama had from blacks, single women, and Hispanics may well reflect the paralysis of these groups due to fear of the uncertainty that exists in the economy.
When the apathy and fear reaches a crisis point in the next few years, probably during our next election in 2016, we will deal with the unmitigated disaster of the irresponsible fiscal spending this nation has been engaged in for decades.
Once this cataclysmic event occurs, the transition will begin. After the crisis starts, most people willingly accept the difficult solutions that were unfathomable only months earlier.
In the case of the U. S. economy, the change that will take place will be the recognition that only by accepting personal responsibility and accountability will our economy ever right itself. If personal responsibility is not accepted, collapse of our nation, as we know it, is inevitable.
The process that I describe above is precisely what happened during the collapse of the Soviet Union. I also experienced the same process in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Belarus in the 1990's. Some of these nations have fared well and some have not depending upon the strength of their leaders to solve the problems.
The nations that fared well have had leaders who understood that simple, quick fixes provide only temporary "solutions" and that serious solutions require systemic changes to society.
A restoration of a free enterprise system with the right of self-determination is essential to survive after the collapse. Free enterprise provides the fuel to the economic engine.
The basic framework of free enterprise once existed in United States and it is a principle which our people typically understand and embrace.
In the United States, we have bountiful natural resources. We generally have a well-educated workforce. We have many baby boomers who are preparing to retire which will create job opportunities for the younger generation.
The self-correction will require that we combine these tremendous assets to counter the negative effects of structural problems in our economy such as public-service unions, unfunded pensions, immigration, and other issues that we have pushed off to another day to solve.
In Alan Greenspan's book, The Age of Turbulence he describes the continued volatility of the world's economies in the 20th Century. In virtually every instance, the countries went through a period of growth, then excess, then denial, then failure, and finally some semblance of rebirth.
For us, Gov. Romney was a great candidate but at the wrong time. Unfortunately for the majority of voters, the message of how serious of a predicament we are in was lost to them. We are going into a full stage period of denial. Gov. Romney was just four years too early.
I am very optimistic of the long term for our country, for as happened with our Founding Fathers, we, too, will have a renewal and rebirth of America and the American dream early in the 21st-century.
We are a creative and vibrant people who believe in Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Those three magical ingredients will fuel our rebirth. It is sad, though, that we need a rebirth when death was avoidable.

On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise coordinated assault against Israel.  In those first few days, the situation was indeed grim.  In the south, some 700 Israeli soldiers manning the neglected Bar Lev fortifications along the Suez Canal faced off against 100,000 Egyptian soldiers backed by 2,000 tanks, thousands of artillery pieces, and hundreds of SAM batteries.  In the north, on Israel's Golan Heights, the situation was no less desperate.  Two understrength armored brigades comprising some 177 Israeli tanks were all that stood between 1,000 Syrian tanks and Galilee.
Despite these overwhelming odds, the Israel Defense Forces stood firm and quickly reversed the situation.  By October 24, just eighteen days after the Arabs commenced their aggression, the Egyptian army was on the brink of collapse, and Israeli forces were operating with impunity over a large swath of Egyptian territory on the West Bank of the Suez Canal.  The Syrians too were in full retreat, and Damascus was now within artillery range of Israeli guns.  So complete was the Arab defeat in the Yom Kippur War that defense analysts have termed it more catastrophic than the Arab defeat of the 1967 Six-Day War.
Curiously and somewhat bizarrely, however, October 6 is marked as a day of celebration in Egypt.  Government-controlled media and Arab historians portray the war as an Arab victory, perpetuating the silly myth.  To Egypt and the Arab world at large, the war began and ended in those first few euphoric days.  The remaining days remain a blur still, buried somewhere deep in the collective Arab subconscious.
This strange behavior of Arab amnesic denial is the norm rather than an aberration.  It follows a consistent and predictable pattern of Arab aggression against Israel followed by the inevitable Arab defeat, followed by a period of denial.  It closes with amnesia relating to the previous mauling, whereupon the cycle of Arab aggression begins anew.
Just nine years after the Yom Kippur War, Syrian and PLO provocations prompted an Israeli invasion of Lebanon, where the PLO had created its own mini-state.  Within a week, Arafat's gagsters were holed up in West Beirut and pummeled by surrounding Israeli troops.  Within two months, the PLO was sent packing to scattered destinations throughout the Middle East -- but this did not dissuade Arafat from referring to the Battle of Beirut as the Battle of Stalingrad.  He used the same ridiculous analogy in the spring of 2002 during Israel's Operation Defensive Shield, referring to the Battle of Jenin as the Battle of "Jeningrad."  Obviously, no one had bothered to inform the terror chieftain that the Soviets actually won the Battle of Stalingrad.  But facts are meaningless in the wacky, make-believe world of Arab fantasy.
Consider Hezb'allah leader Hassan Nasrallah's comical boast that he had scored a "divine victory" over Israel during the 2006 Second Lebanon War.  The absurdity of Nasrallah's boast led one of Lebanon's leading commentators, Michael Young, to note that if Nasrallah considered the 2006 war a victory, "one dreads to imagine what Hezbollah would recognize as a military loss."
We've now come full circle with Operation Pillar of Defense.  No sooner did Hamas cry uncle than their fearless leaders emerge from their pitiful sewers holes to declare "victory."  Barely three years have passed since Operation Cast Lead, in which Hamas received a similar thrashing at the hands of Israel.  Then as now, upon cessation of Israeli combat operations, the fearless leaders of Hamas emerged from their basement hideouts beneath Shifa Hospital to declare "victory."  Then as now, Hamas was bloodied and defeated and was unable to inflict any symbolic or significant damage to Israel.
And so, in the latest round of Arab initiated belligerency, we've witnessed three of the four predictable stages -- Arab aggression, Arab defeat, and Arab denial.  That war will come is a virtual certainty, but it is contingent on how quickly Arab amnesia sets in.  No one can predict when that will occur.  What we can predict with near certainty is that when war does break out, it will be followed by another Arab defeat.  Until ordinary moderate Muslims -- and there are too few of those -- recognize that their fascist leaders are guiding them into medieval backwardness, Arabs will continue to experience defeat and humiliation in perpetuity.

Collectivists of the Washington establishment, representing both major parties, have analyzed the 2012 election results and come to a lovely conclusion: old white men are the problem. The only difference of opinion between the two factions regards how one ought to handle it. 
Democrat experts declare that laughable old coots are the natural core of the Republican Party, so one need only join the cool leftist majority and leave Grandpa in his kitchen chair to mutter to himself until death shuts him up for good. Republican experts, as the reluctant stewards of these cantankerous fogies, are more circumspect: they merely want to leave Grandpa ranting in the corner with his talk radio shows, while they attend to the urgent business of selling off his prized possessions (e.g. property rights, national sovereignty).
On one side we have the Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Paul Krugman types haughtily declaring that the Democrats are the party of women and minorities, and the Republicans the party of old white men. See how colorful, female, and young we look? See how monotonously white and graying they look?
On the other side we have campaign strategist Steve Schmidt, ACU chairman Al Cardenas, and others declaring that "Rush Limbaugh's audience" should be ignored as a bunch of old white men who (apparently for that very reason) no longer represent America. Since when is "representing America" a matter of head counts and demographics, rather than of principles? Such thinking seems reasonable only to men who have lost the forest of encroaching leftist authoritarianism for the trees of electoral victory. (See how well their Constitution Fire Sale method has worked out so far!)
This mocking, bitter dismissal of the mature white male is a nearly poetic symbol -- as if we needed another one -- of the degraded state of civilization. Old men -- whether white, black, olive, yellow, or red -- have traditionally been regarded as the sage voices in their communities with regard to matters of public policy and private virtue. Having seen more, learned from mistakes, and grown weary of youth's careless chasing after the chimerical "new," they have commonly been appreciated as a steady source of common sense and moral rectitude. Age may not necessarily bring genuine wisdom, but it has traditionally served an invaluable function in humanity's natural system of checks and balances: it casts a skeptical eye upon youth's grand designs, thus raining on the often misguided parade of "progress."
Before anyone else raises it, let me state up front that I know, and actually agree with, the counterargument to the effect that today's "seniors" include the very gang that delivered the world into its current catastrophe. What I disagree with is the generic follow-up to this, namely, "So why should we listen to them?"
The answer is that we should listen to those among them who, during their lifetimes, watched friends and family succumb to the dark side, but had the courage and intelligence to resist, as well as to those who once embraced the "forward"-looking project of social progress, but have since come to a reckoning about the true nature of their youthful fantasies. The first group teaches us steadfastness; the second teaches us the indispensable lessons of one who has traveled to the underworld and lived to tell about it.
A few words, then, in defense of old white men.
I have had the good fortune of making the acquaintance of many of my American readers. Most of them are in a state of disillusionment, anger, and confusion about the current state of their country, and how to proceed from here.
The most poignant cases, however, are usually found among my older friends. Many of them are men who had not necessarily conceived of themselves as freedom fighters or guardians of any flame, but who have simply come to a realization in recent years that watching their society disintegrate is not a satisfying option. Some of them openly fear for the future of their children and grandchildren. Some are disgusted that freedom's history of bloody sacrifice -- of friends, fathers, and fellow citizens -- is now being so cavalierly negated by an America eagerly welcoming the very chains that ordinary men gave their lives to break just a short time ago.
Two of these friends of mine, both grandfathers, have started up a talk radio program in Minnesota. They pay for the airtime out of their own pockets and solicit public support to stay on the air. And yet their program is as engaging and informative as any of the big name syndicated shows, and their guest list reads like a who's who of serious conservative commentary: Roger Kimball, Bill Whittle, David Horowitz, Andrew McCarthy, and on and on, including even a bunch of American Thinker regulars, yours truly among them.
Then there is another man who, in his sixties, decided he had had enough of the establishment media elite selecting which news is fit to be buried. He started up his own news aggregator, highlighting conservative (not Republican) news and views. Disappointments and frustrations have forced him to rethink the content and focus of his website, but he remains determined to make a difference within the context of the new media.
One of my regular readers is a man in his late seventies who insists on addressing me as "Doctor" out of genuine, even excessive, respect for the spirit of higher education, and who has become a dear friend by engaging me in some of the most thoughtful commentaries/discussions I could ever have hoped for. He is continually recommending books for me to read, suggesting topics for me to look into, and generally enriching my thought processes with his historical perspective, stoicism, and good humor in the face of disaster.
Here is the point: all of these men, like so many thousands of others, have watched in incremental horror as, over the course of their lives, the ground has opened up and swallowed their country. They know they cannot stop it from happening, that they are each of them a whispering voice against a screaming mob. Or if any of them did not know this, they learned it once and for all on November 6, when America held its first direct referendum on freedom vs. despotism, and freedom lost.
And yet they fight on. They understand that the task may be Sisyphean, but they feel bereft of alternatives. After their lives of productive work, building and rebuilding dreams, saving for the future, and hoping to reap the benefits of responsible self-reliance and good citizenship, they now see that they must spend the rest of their days either lamenting the loss of all they had loved and depended on in their nation, or rearming themselves once more for battle, like Nestor, Agamemnon's venerable advisor.To a man, they know that the America of which they were proud citizens is no more. All men, as they reach the final third of life's marathon, gradually learn how to be resilient against the repeated blows of disappointment and loss. No one, however, having once lived semi-free, or at least in a country founded on principles of freedom, should have to face the ultimate loss in his final decades: the loss of the dignity of a life lived in liberty.Yet now, that contingent of mature men who in the face of exactly such an indignity are responding with courageous engagement, resisting civilization's decline and fighting for a future they will not inherit, are being spoken of with supreme mockery by the very villains who have robbed them of their country, and with dismissiveness by those behind whom they had reluctantly thrown their support.This is the final stage of democracy unmoored from principle and historical perspective, as predicted by all the great critics, from Plato to Tocqueville. Mindless reverence for the young, the new, the emergent, the progressive, though selling itself as a doctrine of hope and optimism, is in truth a dogma of hatred and moral indecency. Its essential message of killing the past, eschewing all tradition, and dissolving all norms -- "Forward!" -- betokens a barely veil
